# Gwent Localization
Translation files for [Gwent: The Witcher Card Game](https://www.playgwent.com/ "playgwent.com") projects.  
Helpful resource to localize your community project.

## Master
The master branch will offer basic translations as json format.  
I use these in my own project (gwent.one)

## Raw
The untouched extracted game files are available in the subfolder.

## DIY
This data is located in the Gwent installation folder  
`\Gwent\Gwent_Data\StreamingAssets\localization`  
You can extract these using the common tools for Unity assets
