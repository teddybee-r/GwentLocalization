# Gwent Localization
Translation files for **Gwent: The Witcher Card Game** projects.  
Helpful resource to localize your community project.

## Master
The master branch will offer basic translations as json format.  
I use these in my own project (gwent.one)

## Branch
The raw extracted game files are available in sub branches.

## DIY
This data is located in the Gwent installation folder  
`\Gwent\Gwent_Data\StreamingAssets\localization`  
You can extract these using the common tools for Unity assets
