avatar_radovid_s04_r10_description;Radovid the Stern, Fifth of His Name, King of Redania, was a polarizing figure. Some considered him a brilliant strategist, a superb general. Others – a bloodthirsty, paranoid madman. The truth lay, as the truth is wont to do, somewhere in the middle.

challenge_faction_1;Northern Realms
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_desc;Radovid the Stern, Fifth of His Name, King of Redania, was a polarizing figure. Some considered him a brilliant strategist, a superb general. Others – a bloodthirsty, paranoid madman. The truth lay, as the truth is wont to do, somewhere in the middle.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_1;Steel Skin
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_1_desc;Radovid liked to say a soldier is only as strong as his breastplate. In the end, even the best swordsman cannot change the tides of battle if he falls to one stray arrow or a single lucky blow. That’s why Radovid never begrudged his infantry quartermasters the coin to buy solid armor.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_1_strategy;Harald deals a lot of damage - boost your units so they don't get destroyed.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_1_strategy_2;Radovid can help you take out Clan Axemen.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_2;Strength in Numbers
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_2_desc;Human soldiers are neither as strong as dwarves nor as dexterous as elves. Yet they have one clear advantage over both elder races: their numbers. Gather a mass of humans, put swords in their hands and a half-decent commander in front… and there is no force that could hope to stop them.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_2_strategy;Watch out for Francesca - she can draw any card she wants at any time.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_2_strategy_2;Use Radovid to deal with resilient units like Mahakam Defenders.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_3;Galloping Death
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_3_desc;Radovid is known for stating there is no problem a gallant charge of heavy cavalry cannot solve. Some doubt the truth of this declaration. Some clearly have not seen Redanian riders in action.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_3_strategy;Dagon can spawn a Hazard at any time, so make sure you've got First Light.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_match_3_strategy_2;Radovid can shut down Ancient Foglets and Barbegazis.
challenge_faction_1_leader_1_title;Radovid
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_desc;King Henselt stumbled ungainly on the dance floor and tripped over his tongue at courtly salons. On the battlefield, however, he moved as deftly as a fish in water. He knew all his infantrymen by name and could recite the range of each and every catapult to the inch.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_1;Wooden Army
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_1_desc;Henselt adored his war machines. He would walk the ranks of his catapults like a proud father, tenderly stroking each ballista and trebuchet. He kept dozens and dozens of these contraptions in reserve – and built more any chance he got.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_1_strategy;Watch out for Calveit - he can grab an extra card from his deck at any time.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_1_strategy_2;Henselt can pull all copies of certain allies in your deck onto the board - use him to quickly gain a decisive lead.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_2;Shoulder to Shoulder
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_2_desc;Henselt would often say two heads are better than one, and three – even better still. Thus he’d always order his troops to march into battle in threes, trios of soldiers fighting shoulder to shoulder. His generals were skeptical of this strategy… But changed their minds when they saw the results.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_2_strategy;Bran can quickly fill his graveyard with units - watch out, because many Skellige abilities interact with the dead.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_2_strategy_2;Henselt can pull all copies of certain allies in your deck onto the board - use him to quickly gain a decisive lead.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_3;Blue Stripes
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_3_desc;When King Foltest answered Henselt’s request for aid with twenty foot soldiers in striped uniforms, Henselt grew furious. What difference could they possibly make...? Well. As it turned out, an enormous one.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_3_strategy;Watch out for Radovid - he'll try to take out any of your units that have powerful passive abilities.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_match_3_strategy_2;Henselt can pull all copies of certain allies in your deck onto the board - use him to quickly gain a decisive lead.
challenge_faction_1_leader_2_title;Henselt
challenge_faction_2;Skellige
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_desc;As a warrior, Harald was thoroughly unremarkable. Then a bear mangled his leg and the bone healed back crooked. After that, each step caused him agonizing pain… and he fought better than ever before. He claimed the grit of constant suffering had honed an unstoppable edge.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_1;Practiced in Pain
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_1_desc;Harald lived his entire life in excruciating pain, making him somewhat of an expert on the subject. This expertise extending to inflicting pain in others as well, to knowing where to strike to cause the greatest possible suffering, to evoke the most gut-wrenching screams. Soon, his foes would throw down their arms as soon as they heard his name.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_1_strategy;Voorhis can reveal cards in your hand, gaining valuable information. Plus, many of his units benefit for every card revealed.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_1_strategy_2;Harald can deal a lot of damage to your enemies - combine this with your units' abilities to defeat your opponent.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_2;Battle Fury
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_2_desc;Cadets at Nilfgaard’s officer academy are drilled in the following rule: only strike a Skelliger if you’re confident your blow will kill. If you merely wound… you will quickly regret it.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_2_strategy;Eithne and her units focus on using special cards. Destroy her units to stop this strategy in its tracks.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_2_strategy_2;Harald can deal a lot of damage to your enemies - combine this with your units' abilities to defeat your opponent.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_3;Bloodlust
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_3_desc;The backbone of Harald’s army consisted of axemen from Clan Tuirseach. These warriors thrived off bloodshed, growing faster, stronger and more resilient with every foe they slew. Harald’s opponents knew they needed either incapacitate the axemen at the start of the battle – or die by their hands.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_3_strategy;The Unseen Elder and his minions will try to steal your units' power. Boost your troops evenly to avoid giving them juicy targets.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_match_3_strategy_2;Harald can deal a lot of damage to your enemies - combine this with your units' abilities to defeat your opponent.
challenge_faction_2_leader_1_title;Harald the Cripple
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_desc;They say the seas smashing against Skellige’s shores would sooner bow to a ruler than its inhabitants. Yet they bowed to Bran. He united all the clans in the isles behind him, and held them together in an iron fist until his death.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_1;Iron Fleet
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_1_desc;When an army loses men, it should grow weaker. It is a simple dictate of logic. Yet Skellige routinely defies dictates, logic’s included. In fact, the fewer warriors Bran has in his charge, the more fiercely they fight. Thus when foes watch his ranks thin and their hearts begin rise… a Skellige axe cleaves them through moments later.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_1_strategy;Brouver and his dwarves focus on boosting and Strengthening each other. Destroy his units to shut this strategy down.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_1_strategy_2;Use Bran to send cards to the graveyard, then Resurrect them when the time is ripe.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_2;Honor Guard
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_2_desc;To say Bran’s personal guard was loyal is like saying winter in the isles tends to be rather chilly, or its seas grow a bit choppy during storms. The Skellige maidens who served as his protectors defended their king fiercely, fighting through any injury short of death itself…and sometimes, through that as well.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_2_strategy;The Arachas Queen tries to amass a mighty army. Try to disrupt this strategy or focus on building up your own strength.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_2_strategy_2;Use Bran to send cards to the graveyard, then Resurrect them when the time is ripe.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_3;Immortal Islanders
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_3_desc;King Bran’s enemies would swear they crossed swords with warriors they had killed personally during earlier battles - not just once, but two times or more. Most think this foolish superstition, the wild tales of scarred soldiers, nothing more… But those who know Skellige well give such stories much credence. In the isles, death is not permanent.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_3_strategy;Watch out for Henselt - he can bring many units onto the board in one move.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_match_3_strategy_2;Use Bran to send cards to the graveyard, then Resurrect them when the time is ripe.
challenge_faction_2_leader_2_title;Bran
challenge_faction_3;Monsters
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_desc;Anyone who's encountered an arachas knows how incredibly lethal these creatures are. Yet few realize the most vicious among them are their females - especially their queen.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_1;Tyrant of the Wild
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_1_desc;The queens of arachas swarms are larger and more powerful than their drones. They dominate and command not only their weaker kin, but also other creatures living near their nest. Woe to any who intrude on their territory.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_1_strategy;Watch out for Calveit - he can grab an extra card from his deck at any time.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_1_strategy_2;The Arachas Queen is immune to most abilities, but can still be destroyed by Scorch. Be careful not to boost her too much.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_2;Natural Selection
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_2_desc;Arachas queens show no motherly love for their offspring. True, they defend their young, but when no other sustenance can be found, they will devour their own children without hesitation. In such cases, only those strong enough to flee the nest early survive.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_2_strategy;Harald deals a lot of damage - boost your units so they don't get destroyed.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_2_strategy_2;The Arachas Queen is immune to most abilities, but can still be destroyed by Scorch. Be careful not to boost her too much.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_3;Survival Instinct
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_3_desc;When her nest is threatened, an enraged arachas queen becomes a terrifying foe. Not only is she faster and stronger than her lesser kin, she also calls upon the help of all those who can hear her cry.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_3_strategy;Foltest will focus on building a strong army. Try to disrupt his strategy or concentrate on bolstering your own forces.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_match_3_strategy_2;The Arachas Queen is immune to most abilities, but can still be destroyed by Scorch. Be careful not to boost her too much.
challenge_faction_3_leader_1_title;Arachas Queen
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_desc;King of the Wild Hunt and usurper of the throne of Tir ná Lia. He assassinated the previous king of the Aen Elle, convinced the old ruler was not equipped to face the threat of the White Frost. Eredin is ruthless and will do anything to save his folk.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_1;Blood of Elves
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_1_desc;The king of the Wild Hunt does not hold his elven cousins, the Aen Seidhe, in high respect. In his eyes, they are weaklings who let "lower" races dominate their world. Thus when the need arises, Eredin does not think twice about spilling elven blood.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_1_strategy;Watch out for Francesca - she can draw any card she wants at any time.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_1_strategy_2;Eredin can spawn powerful allies - use him at the right time to gain the advantage.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_2;Slave Hunters
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_2_desc;Skellige is one of Eredin's favorite hunting grounds for new slaves. The isles' warriors are fierce and hearty, perfect for physical labor on Tir ná Lia. But that is not the only reason. The King of the Hunt draws sadistic pleasure from breaking these proud men and women.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_2_strategy;Crach's warriors can grow to be very powerful if you let them. Try to knock them off the board as soon as you can.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_2_strategy_2;Eredin can spawn powerful allies - use him at the right time to gain the advantage.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_3;Horseman of the Apocalypse
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_3_desc;Wherever Eredin roams, he brings frost and death with him. The King of the Hunt is not only an expert swordsman, but also a master of magic arcana. Whenever he needs, he can summon more warriors from Tir ná Lia. No wonder, then, the appearance of the Wild Hunt arouses wails of terror.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_3_strategy;The Arachas Queen tries to amass a mighty army. Try to disrupt this strategy or focus on building up your own strength.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_match_3_strategy_2;Eredin can spawn powerful allies - use him at the right time to gain the advantage.
challenge_faction_3_leader_2_title;Eredin
challenge_faction_4;Scoia'tael
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_desc;Even mortal enemies sometimes find common cause and make fragile pacts. Yet not Eithné, no. The queen of the dryads’ hatred for humans is absolute, brooking no exceptions. No matter how they plead, beg or threaten, she always gives them the same answer - an arrow to the head.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_1;Defenders of Brokilon
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_1_desc;Brokilon is no common wood. This ancient entanglement of trees hums with magic, a primal energy pulsing from its soft breezes and burbling brooks. The dryads have learned draw on this, taking from it strength far beyond that of any man or elf.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_1_strategy;Emhyr can replay one of his allies, triggering its ability again. Destroy them before he gets a chance.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_1_strategy_2;Eithne lets you play a special card from your graveyard - use her to play Reconnaissance and build up your army.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_2;The Elder Race Alliance
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_2_desc;Dryads are distrustful by nature and avoid all outsiders. They only make exceptions for elves, with whom they will join forces when outnumbered. In such cases, the enemy’s numerical superiority quickly counts for very little. All those not cut down by elven blades succumb to powerful dryadic spells.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_2_strategy;Eredin and his allies can spawn Frost, so keep First Light at the ready.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_2_strategy_2;Eithne lets you play a special card from the graveyard - use her to get rid of Frost whenever Eredin spawns it.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_3;The Waters of Brokilon
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_3_desc;The waters of Brokilon are famed for their extraordinary properties. People who drink of them lose their memory and dryads are said to see visions of the future in their smooth surfaces. No wonder, then, that their armies seem prepared for every eventuality…
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_3_strategy;Watch out for Henselt - he can bring many units onto the board in one move.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_match_3_strategy_2;Eithne lets you play a special card from your graveyard - use her to play Reconnaissance and build up your army.
challenge_faction_4_leader_1_title;Eithné
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_desc;Francesca Findabair, known as the Daisy of the Valley, is widely considered the most beautiful woman in the world. Her physical charms are matched only by her enormous magic talent and keen political instincts.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_1;Queen of Elves
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_1_desc;The Free Elves of Dol Blathanna owe Francesca everything they have - thus it comes as no surprise they are willing to die with her name on their lips. Yet the Scoia'tael do not respect her with similar ardor. They begrudge her all the elven blood she spilt for, in their eyes, a futile cause.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_1_strategy;Bran can quickly fill his graveyard with units - watch out, because many Skellige abilities interact with the dead.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_1_strategy_2;Francesca lets you draw a new card at any time - use this to gain the advantage.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_2;Visionary
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_2_desc;During the Second Northern War, she signed a pact with the Nilfgaardian Empire that let the Free Elves rebuild a realm of their own in Dol Blathanna. Yet when the war ended, fighting broke out between the Empire and Scoia'tael warriors…
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_2_strategy;Voorhis can reveal cards in your hand, gaining valuable information. Plus, many of his units benefit for every card revealed.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_2_strategy_2;Francesca lets you draw a new card at any time - use this to gain the advantage.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_3;Archmistress
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_3_desc;Before the war Francesca was a member of the Conclave of Mages and later joined the mysterious Lodge of Sorceresses. Her great magic talent earned her respect and awe from her colleagues, though no one truly knows the full extent of her abilities.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_3_strategy;Dagon can spawn a Hazard at any time, so make sure you've got First Light.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_match_3_strategy_2;Francesca lets you draw a new card at any time - use this to gain the advantage.
challenge_faction_4_leader_2_title;Francesca
challenge_faction_5;Nilfgaard
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_desc;Emhyr var Emreis, the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of his Foes, well deserves his nickname. Ever since he tore the imperial diadem out of the Usurper's hands, he dedicated all the power at his disposal to eliminating his political enemies.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_1;Worthy Rival
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_1_desc;After eliminating most of the kings of the Northern Realms, Emhyr thought Nilfgaard's victory in the Third Northern War would be swift and complete. To his surprise, he found himself facing a worthy foe in the form of King Radovid the Fifth.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_1_strategy;Watch out for Radovid - he'll try to take out any of your units that have powerful passive abilities.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_1_strategy_2;Emhyr lets you replay one of your allies, triggering its ability again. Try to use him on a powerful unit before your opponent destroys it.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_2;Countless Armies
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_2_desc;Emhyr always considered the witcher caste a relict of a bygone era. The mutants made superb killers, true, but he preferred to eliminate monsters using other, cheaper methods.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_2_strategy;Eredin and his allies can spawn Frost, so keep First Light at the ready.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_2_strategy_2;Emhyr lets you replay one of your allies, triggering its ability again. Try to use him on a powerful unit before your opponent destroys it.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_3;Cast-Off Tools
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_3_desc;The Scoia'tael were one of the tools Emhyr wielded during the Second Northern War. Their purpose: to spread chaos behind enemy lines. With the war's end, their usefulness expired and their questionable methods became a bone of contention during diplomatic talks with the kings of the North.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_3_strategy;Eithne and her units focus on using special cards. Destroy her units to stop this strategy in its tracks.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_match_3_strategy_2;Emhyr lets you replay one of your allies, triggering its ability again. Try to use him on a powerful unit before your opponent destroys it.
challenge_faction_5_leader_1_title;Emhyr
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_desc;Morvran Voorhis was fond of saying he could win a war without a single sword. There was much truth in that: Voorhis’ strategy revolved around the shrewd use of spies and saboteurs. This might not have earned him much honor – but it did earn him a great many victories..
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_1;Diplomatic Arts
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_1_desc;Morvran Voorhis liked to keep close tabs on his enemy’s activities. To this end, he would write them numerous lengthy letters. The contents were pure drivel, flowery formulations saying exactly nothing, but the emissaries he sent to deliver them kept their eyes wide open…
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_1_strategy;Crach's warriors can grow to be very powerful if you let them. Try to knock them off the board as soon as you can.
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_1_strategy_2;Voorhis lets you reveal cards in your opponent's hand - use him to predict their moves. Remember you can also reveal your own cards to trigger your units' abilities.
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_2;Questionable Loyalty
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_2_desc;Morvran Voorhis cultivated both a wide-ranging network of skilled spies working on the empire’s behalf… and special Nauzicaa Brigade officers devoted to dealing with agents foolish enough to betray it.
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_2_strategy;Brouver and his dwarves focus on boosting and Strengthening each other. Destroy his units to shut this strategy down.
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_2_strategy_2;Voorhis lets you reveal cards in your opponent's hand - use him to predict their moves. Remember you can also reveal your own cards to trigger your units' abilities.
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_3;Double Agents
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_3_desc;Voorhis recognized no rules in warfare. To vanquish, he was willing to make common cause with anyone, be they renegades from witcher schools, war criminals or rebellious mages. Only one thing mattered: victory.
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_3_strategy;The Unseen Elder and his minions will try to steal your units' power. Boost your troops evenly to avoid giving them juicy targets.
challenge_faction_5_leader_2_match_3_strategy_2;Voorhis lets you reveal cards in your opponent's hand - use him to predict their moves. Remember you can also reveal your own cards to trigger your units' abilities.

faction_monster_name;Monsters
faction_monsters_0_desc_name;White Frost
faction_monsters_0_desc_text;<color=#ef7070><link=20005501>White Frost</link></color> allows you to move an opponent’s unit to the other row and apply <color=#ef7070><link=frost>Frost</link></color>, which will then damage the highest-power unit on that row by 2 for the next 2 turns. This can be particularly useful as a counter to enemy cards with abilities tied to a specific row.
faction_monsters_1_desc_name;Dominance
faction_monsters_1_desc_text;Cards with <color=#ef7070><link=dominance>Dominance</link></color>, such as <color=#ef7070><link=13240200>Wild Hunt Hound</link></color>, unlock their full potential when you control the highest-power unit on the battlefield. This highest-power unit can also be the card played, allowing you to play <color=#ef7070><link=13231000>Wild Hunt Rider</link></color> on an empty board and benefit from its <color=#ef7070><link=dominance>Dominance</link></color>.
faction_monsters_2_desc_name;Frost
faction_monsters_2_desc_text;Applying <color=#ef7070><link=frost>Frost</link></color> with a card such as <color=#ef7070><link=20261200>Naglfar’s Crew</link></color>⁠ to a row that already has <color=#ef7070><link=frost>Frost</link></color> will increase the current effect’s duration. Remember to choose which row to apply <color=#ef7070><link=frost>Frost</link></color> to carefully as it can be critical to maintaining <color=#ef7070><link=dominance>Dominance</link></color> for your other cards.
faction_monsters_description;Lead the Wild Hunt cavalcade and bring yet another world to its knees!
faction_neutral_name;Neutral
faction_nilfgaard_0_desc_name;Double Cross
faction_nilfgaard_0_desc_text;<color=#ef7070><link=20218601>Double Cross</link></color> allows you to take a peek at 3 of the cards in your opponent’s hand and choose one to copy and then play. This can be particularly effective when your opponent has only 3 cards left, as it will tell you exactly what tools your opponent has left to use against you.
faction_nilfgaard_1_desc_name;Assimilate
faction_nilfgaard_1_desc_text;Cards with <color=#ef7070><link=assimilate>Assimilate</link></color> will receive a boost each time you play a card that wasn’t in your starting deck. <color=#ef7070><link=20223900>Artorius Vigo</link></color>, for example, will create a copy of one of the bronze cards in your starting deck and will boost himself and all other <color=#ef7070><link=assimilate>Assimilate</link></color> cards you control by 1 (unless specified differently) after doing so.
faction_nilfgaard_2_desc_name;Disloyal
faction_nilfgaard_2_desc_text;Cards like <color=#ef7070><link=20224800>Duchess’s Informant</link></color> are <color=#ef7070><link=disloyal>Disloyal</link></color>, meaning you must play them on your opponent’s side of the board. These cards will also gain a <color=#ef7070><link=spying>Spying</link></color> status once played. <color=#ef7070><link=20224800>Duchess’s Informant</link></color> creates a copy of a bronze enemy card for you to play on your side, and is useful for stealing your opponent’s strategy.
faction_nilfgaard_description;Use whatever means necessary to increase the reach of the Empire.
faction_nilfgaard_name;Nilfgaard
faction_northern_description;The Northern Realms boast powerful mages and siege engines that rain fire upon their foes.
faction_northern_name;Northern Realms
faction_northernrealms_0_desc_name;Uprising
faction_northernrealms_0_desc_text;<color=#ef7070><link=20257401>Uprising</link></color> lets you boost a unit 3 times, allowing you to protect valuable cards. For maximum efficiency, save your charges until you’re ready to deploy the <color=#ef7070><link=20216100>Lyrian Scytheman</link></color>, which will be created once you’ve used up all charges. Deploy this card to a row filled with boosted units to perform a powerful finishing play.
faction_northernrealms_1_desc_name;Inspired
faction_northernrealms_1_desc_text;Cards like <color=#ef7070><link=20215200>Anna Strenger</link></color> have stronger abilities when <color=#ef7070><link=inspired>Inspired</link></color>, meaning when they are boosted above their base power, their impact on the battlefield grows. It’s usually wise to prioritize boosting such units to gain the upper hand.
faction_northernrealms_2_desc_name;Formation
faction_northernrealms_2_desc_text;Cards with <color=#ef7070><link=order>Orders</link></color> can not normally execute their ability until the turn after they are played. However, those with the <color=#ef7070><link=formation>Formation</link></color> keyword⁠ ⁠— like <color=#ef7070><link=20242100>Radovid’s Royal Guards</link></color> ⁠— have the option to do so. Play these cards on the melee row to use their order ability immediately, OR play them on the ranged row to gain one point of boost.
faction_northernrealms_description;Unite your forces and bolster them to overpower any foe.
faction_scoiatael_0_desc_name;Nature’s Gift
faction_scoiatael_0_desc_text;<color=#ef7070><link=20016501>Nature’s Gift</link></color> can be used 3 times to give a unit <color=#ef7070><link=vitality>Vitality</link></color> ⁠— a status that boosts them by 1 at the end of your current and next turn. It can be especially effective on <color=#ef7070><link=20267800>Hamadryads</link></color> and can be applied multiple times to the same unit to extend its duration.
faction_scoiatael_1_desc_name;Symbiosis
faction_scoiatael_1_desc_text;Thanks to the <color=#ef7070><link=symbiosis>Symbiosis</link></color> ability of <color=#ef7070><link=20016500>Nature’s Gift</link></color>, whenever you play a special card with the <color=#ef7070><link=nature>Nature</link></color> category ⁠— like <color=#ef7070><link=20226900>Dryad’s Caress</link></color> ⁠— you will spawn a 1-power Treant on the board. The power of the <color=#ef7070><link=20268300>Treants</link></color> you create increases by 1 for every unit with <color=#ef7070><link=symbiosis>Symbiosis</link></color> you currently control.
faction_scoiatael_2_desc_name;Hand boosting
faction_scoiatael_2_desc_text;Play cards like  <color=#ef7070><link=20267700>Circle of Life</link></color> early in a round to boost a random Scoia’tael unit in your hand before you play it. With this special card, if you manage to kill the unit you damage, the <color=#ef7070><link=deathblow>Deathblow</link></color> effect will allow you to choose which unit gets boosted.
faction_scoiatael_description;Use the power of nature to grow your army and defend your forests from invaders.
faction_scoiatael_name;Scoia'tael
faction_select_deck_button;Select Deck
faction_select_popup_warning;Are you sure? You will unlock other decks shortly.
faction_skellige_0_desc_name;Patricidal Fury
faction_skellige_0_desc_text;Use <color=#ef7070><link=20211901>Patricidal Fury</link></color> to unleash <color=#ef7070><link=20218200>Arnjolf the Patricide</link></color>. This not only grants you an 11-point body but also results in 3 damaged sirens on the enemy side, allowing you to gain even more power from cards like <color=#ef7070><link=15210600>Madman Lugos</link></color>. It can also be used to fill up your opponent’s row, preventing them from playing more cards on it.
faction_skellige_1_desc_name;Veteran
faction_skellige_1_desc_text;Skellige warriors only get stronger as the battle drags on. Each round, cards with <color=#ef7070><link=veteran>Veteran</link></color> gain 1 base power, making cards like <color=#ef7070><link=20262300>Tuirseach Invader</link></color> that much better in later rounds.
faction_skellige_2_desc_name;Bloodthirst
faction_skellige_2_desc_text;<color=#ef7070><link=20262400>An Craite Raiders</link></color> let you deal 2 damage to a unit of your choice on the turn after it’s played. Its <color=#ef7070><link=bloodthirst>Bloodthirst</link></color> condition allows you to deal this damage immediately after playing it via the <color=#ef7070><link=zeal>Zeal</link></color> ability, but only if your opponent has at least 3 damaged units.

journey_1_story_extended_12;Geralt did not dance.\nAt least he avoided it as much as possible, since navigating the rabble before him required either timely jumps or forceful shoving. The witcher again was looking for Dandelion, who was swallowed by the crowd as soon as the the idiotic tradition began. Instead he spotted a wealthy yet old looking merchant seeming at a loss regarding the actions of his distant fiance. Devils only knew if she ever told the poor fool of her new intentions.\nGeralt pushed forward. Some of the dancing townsfolk tried to stop him, although without much effect. The music bellowed ever louder, making any conversation impossible. Despite this madness, the witcher finally managed to find within the crowd a distinct hat decorated with the feather of a heron. Its owner, to no surprise of the witcher, was obscured by four familiar looking thugs.\nNot wishing to waste a moment longer, Geralt shoved the first of the brothers with all his weight deep into the crowd, away from Dandelion. He then smashed the second one, sending him to the ground, where he fell right under the poet’s feet. He found himself holding the wrist of the third one while the bard performed some idiotic and pointless pirouettes. The witcher ended this spectacle by kicking the ruffian's legs out, sending him hurling onto his back. The fourth took seemingly forever to deal with, mainly due to Dandelion. The poet acted like a jester, trying to mislead his opponent before finally fleeing away. The thug, one moment intent on taking the chase, suddenly turned towards the sound of now screaming Kora. Her original suitor had embraced the poor girl possessively with misery marking her lovely face as she scanned the crowd for one poetic savior. Who, of course, was nowhere to be seen at this point. Meanwhile the witcher, having had his fill of getting involved in the affairs of others, turned and made his way back to the stables.\nHe smiled to himself as he entered to the sight of the bard on the ground. Dandelion was kneeling dramatically, clearly unaware that if he glanced to the left, he would have seen his lute sticking out of Roach's saddlebags. So Geralt smiled, took out the music instrument and told the clumsy fool to compose himself, ending this miserable show.\nSome time later, once on his saddle and well underway to the gates leaving Gulet, he glanced back at the bard who now followed him. It seemed like Dandelion meant to journey with the witcher,\neven to the edge of the world.

journey_1_story_standard_12;Dandelion danced.\nHe danced with all his vigor. Following Gulet traditions, the groom was tasked with rescuing his blushing bride trapped within a densely dancing crowd. Only then could the wedding ceremony begin in earnest. The bard, rightfully so, saw this as his last opportunity to escape his predicament. Unfortunately, his soon-to-be brothers-in-law shared the same viewpoint. They had preemptively blocked his likely escape route and were in the process of forcibly leading him towards their sister, Kora.\nDandelion would not be so easily deterred. Participants all around were busily dancing and laughing as they carelessly bumped into one another. Fortunately, this was preventing him from reaching his bride. Lively music filled his ears as the world began spinning around him. Nevertheless, the bard found a rhythm to this madness and proceeded to dance his way out.\nHe passed by the first of the brothers with a few well-timed sharp turns. He smirked, stomping on the second one, who just happened to trip clumsily. The third he took by hand, twisting it in a pirouette only to let it go at the just the right moment for his opponent to lose his balance. The fourth proved to be the most difficult. Dandelion jumped right, jumped left, made a turn, yet the muscle head reacted to his movements like a mirror image. The poet, feeling desperate, decided to attempt a simple trick by taking a step back. The oaf also backed up, so Dandelion continued until finally he just turned around and fled. As he disappeared behind the nearest stall, he heard Kora's desperate cry but did not dare risk looking back.\nNow was his chance to be free, yet first, the poet had to find his precious lute. Thus he began wandering the alleys of Gulet in search of the witcher, feeling resentful and abandoned. In a move of desperation, he made his way to the stables hoping that Geralt had not yet departed this foul city. He groaned miserably upon seeing the horse's absence, then knelt, and bowed his head. The witcher, his steed, and the bard's lute were surely long gone. Dandelion was once again all alone, stripped of his belongings, and unfairly punished by fate.\nIn the height of his despair, a shadow rose behind him. A shadow with a lute in one hand and reins in the other. A shadow with a voice hoarse from vodka, asking the bard to stand the fuck up.\nDandelion turned, overjoyed at this newfound luck.\nHe could sense that this was just the beginning of their journey together.

journey_2_quest_3_extended_title;Be like a cat
journey_2_quest_3_standard_title;Sly like the fox
journey_2_story_1;Wait, I forgot about the mugs! Let me just grab them from the saddle.\n\nOkay, back to the fire. Now, where do I start? There was so much of it, uncle Vesemir. It’s just hard to recall the first thing⁠—oh! I got it! It’s not from our training or theory lessons though ...\n\nDo you remember the fairy tale about the tabby cat and the red fox? The one where hunters wanted to tear their fur off? Make them into muffs? Of course you remember. How many times have you told it as a bedtime story to the kids of Kaer Morhen? Dozens? Hundreds? Even to Geralt, right? I just can’t seem to imagine him as a child. Was he ever, really?\n\nOkay, I know. He had to be.\n\nAnyway, it was Geralt, who told me this fairy tale when I was just little. Ugh, I didn't like it when others would call me "little" back then, and now here I am doing it myself. Well, that’s the truth: I was little. And lost. And all alone. I had fled from King Ervyll’s men and his nasty son, Kistrin, whom I really, really didn’t want to marry. I mean, his breath alone—eugh! Anyway … that’s how I ended up lost in Brokilon forest. And that’s where I’d have died, if it wasn’t for Geralt. If he hadn’t shown up out of nowhere and killed this overgrown centipede … Oh, I know, I know! Not a centipede, but a yghern, also known as the scolopendromorph. However, you must admit, even in the engravings it looks just like an overgrown centipede.\n\nSo Geralt rescued me from the yghern, and later, when I was lying on the forest floor with the stars blinking at us through the crowns of trees, unable to fall asleep, he told me your bedtime story. About the cat and fox hunted down by humans. In a way, despite not having met yet, it was the first lesson you gave me. It’s pretty good, by the way. While escaping, it's usually better to act like a cat rather than try to be clever like a fox. Just quickly, react without a second thought, without trying some thousand two hundred and eighty-six plots to outsmart the hunter. Do one: hop up the tree. Run away. Don’t look back.\n\nOtherwise you end up as a piece of decorative fur. Like this red muff.

mon_fluff_description;Humans like to think they are the masters of the Continent. Yet it's enough to stray from the beaten path, or perk one's ears when the moon waxes full, to understand the folly of such arrogance. In dense forests, shadowy ravines, and the damp, musty cellars of abandoned homes, countless eyes glow bright and sharp fangs drip wet... A monstrous swarm will await the opportune moment to emerge and feed. Frenzied with bloodlust, they strike with reckless abandon. Fortunately, such uncoordinated attacks can sometimes be fended off. Yet when one takes command of the beasts and gives them purpose, well... No wall, nor shield, nor metal plate upon your breast will prove enough. Human blood will flow and screams of terror shall pierce the night.

nilf_fluff_description;Left, right, left, right... All of the Continent shakes under the disciplined march of Nilfgaard's heavy infantry. And in their wake follow fire-heaving siege machines, silver-tongued emissaries, cutthroat assassins wielding toxin-laced, serpentine daggers... From behind barred doors and shuttered windows, the people of the North watch with horror, quietly muttering their desperate pleas to Melitele... "Good Mother, deliver us from evil most foul. Spare from ruin our harvests, and from chains our babes..." Yet, if the pillars of smoke billowing along the Pontar and the Yaruga are any indication, it seems their prayers fall on deaf ears.

nor_fluff_description;In no royal court nor library will one ever find an accurate map of the Northern Realms. For whenever a cartographer has drawn his last border, one of the land's many kings, princes, or margraves has already invaded his neighbor, once again altering the political fabric of the North. Disputes and rivalries rage on without end – Aedirn and Kaedwen, Temeria and Lyria... Yet, in this cycle of madness, the Nordlings emerge as seasoned warriors, resilient folk accustomed to both strife and sacrifice. They are a difficult people to break – especially when the time comes for them to set aside their petty differences and stand united against a common foe. Alas, the air of shared victory does not linger long before they once again leap at each other's throats...

reward_tree_adda_chest_1;Upon discovering Adda had been transformed into a striga, King Foltest immediately promised a weighty reward to any who could disenchant the princess... And a swift retribution to any who dared slay her. A long while passed before someone stepped up to the task. The volunteer turned out to be none other than Geralt of Rivia, a witcher from the School of the Wolf.
reward_tree_adda_chest_2;After Geralt lifted the curse, it seemed Adda had become an ordinary girl. Pleasant, eloquent, undeniably beautiful – she quickly became the pride and joy of the Temerian court. However, dark rumors began to circulate among the royal family's servants. In her bedchamber, away from prying eyes, Adda had committed horrible atrocities against her maidservants... Though, details remain unknown as many were never to be seen again.
reward_tree_adda_chest_3;A telling sign that Adda's curse had not been fully undone was her love for catoblepas flesh. The meat of a catoblepas – known also as a gorgon – has a very peculiar taste, disturbingly similar to that of human flesh. Considering the beasts are scarce and their meat a rare delicacy at banquets in the Temerian court, Princess Adda was forced to settle for a more readily available substitute.
reward_tree_adda_story_pt1;A beautiful young girl with a button nose and a storm of red hair – what's there to fear? Well, appearances can be deceiving... And in Adda's case, more so than usual.
reward_tree_adda_story_pt2;It appeared the witcher had, indeed, cured the ghastly affliction that gave Adda the rather nasty habit of turning into a striga. But if you believe the rumors, the princess has been known to relapse.
reward_tree_adda_story_pt3;At first, it was thought Adda had been cursed by the gods, for she was the product of an incestuous affair between King Foltest and his sister, Adda of Temeria. The truth, as is often the case, was revealed to be quite different...
reward_tree_adda_story_pt4;The witcher's investigation showed that a romantically-frustrated courtier by name of Ostrit was responsible for Adda's curse. Unsurprisingly, it seemed the gods had played no role, proving yet again to be indifferent toward the foul deeds of man... Fortunately, one does not require divine power to rout out wickedness.
reward_tree_adda_title;Princess Adda
reward_tree_anna_chest_1;Anna Henrietta never felt the weight of a sword in her hand, pondered the memoirs of great rulers, nor cared enough to deeply study the Continent's rich history. Yet these apparent faults have done little to diminish her duchy's successes in matters of war. Her secret? Knight-errants from across the Continent – drawn by word of Anna's beauty and charm – are willing to sacrifice anything to earn the duchess's favor. From a safe distance, in the company of her maidservants, Anna Henrietta fans herself as the chivalrous knights' declare their vows—casting them beguiling looks as they gallop off toward their doom.
reward_tree_anna_chest_2;When it comes to grace and couture, none go to greater lengths than the duchess herself. Gods forbid she be caught wearing the same gown twice, and woe betide any soul who spies Her Grace before her frizzy curls have been tamed into a perfectly symmetrical coiffure. However, should circumstances demand it, Anarietta would not hesistate to tear off her frilly skirt to mount the nearest steed and rush headlong into another adventure.
reward_tree_anna_chest_3;Despite Toussaint's status as a vassal state within the mighty Nilfgaardian Empire, Anna Henrietta never faced a significant conflict within its borders. It should come as no great surprise then that Beauclair's guardsmen are better trained for parades and fanfare than mortal combat. Thus, when vampires and other bloodthirsty beasts emerged to feast from the caverns deep beneath the duchy's capital, the city's only hope rushed to meet them with dull blades and frilled caftans—only to be decimated. Yet for those who survived, nothing could have better prepared them for the true horrors of war.
reward_tree_anna_story_pt1;Duchess Anna Henrietta is widely revered for her many favorable qualities—in particular, her generosity, kindheartedness and sensitivity to the plight of Toussaint's commoners. If only she had but a touch more patience and perspective—why, she would have all the makings of a truly prodigious sovereign!
reward_tree_anna_story_pt2;The famed bard Dandelion who, for a time, became intimately entwined with Anna Henrietta, drew creative inspiration from his passionate affair with the duchess: "Across the world most fickle I've found, a mountain's weather and a little weasel crowned."
reward_tree_anna_story_pt3;Though perhaps not the wittiest words penned by the illustrious poet, they bring light to a very real problem. Anna Henrietta was prone to sudden changes of opinion without provocation—a reality that oft caused the already powdered faces of the duchess's court to turn a shade paler.
reward_tree_anna_story_pt4;For, when the duchess fell into a gracious mood, she doled out great riches and noble titles like chocolate soufflés at a royal banquet. Yet, should anything disrupt her fragile equilibrium, heads rolled down Beauclair's cobbled streets and crimson blood pooled on the palace's marbled floors.
reward_tree_anna_title;Anna Henrietta
reward_tree_arachas_chest_1;Once native to the far south, this invasive species migrated north over the course of decades, adjusting as it went to new climates and temperatures. It finds damp woodlands and swamps most hospitable and made them its home, making use of the mulch and moss found there as cover during its winter hibernation. Arachasae often hide their unprotected, sac-like abdomens under a hollow tree-trunk shell worn on their back... Unfortunately, as a result, overlooking them is a far too common – and lethal –mistake.
reward_tree_arachas_chest_2;At first glance, a stationary arachas often looks like a part of the forest undergrowth, a fact it uses to deadly advantage when hunting. It usually begins a battle by spitting venom, then tries to grab its prey with prehensile feelers in order to drag it within reach of its crushing pincers. The best defense against its tactics, you ask? There isn't one.
reward_tree_arachas_chest_3;According to scholars at Oxenfurt, the hive queens of most insect and insectoid species are almost completely defenseless. Arachasae, however, are a notable exception. An arachas queen is the largest and strongest in her swarm. A single drop of her venom is enough to bring down an adult man, a swipe of their claws can cleave through a Nilfgaardian pavise as if through butter. When two arachasae swarms vie for territory and the queens battle for supremacy, all other woodland creatures flee the forest with haste, as if escaping a raging wildfire...
reward_tree_arachas_story_pt1;“N’aracche aen woed endicen."\n– Elven proverb\n"Let sleeping arachasae lie." Sage advice... For where there's one, the queen is likely not far off.
reward_tree_arachas_story_pt2;And woe shall befall any who strays across her path. Many monsters can be deceived, enticed, or by fire and silver scared off... Yet, an arachas queen is no ordinary monster.
reward_tree_arachas_story_pt3;She is driven by raw, primal instinct. Kill, eat, breed, kill, eat, breed... In a single week, a queen can lay over one thousand eggs. If not destroyed in time, you'd be advised to find a new home. And quickly.
reward_tree_arachas_story_pt4;The swarm's allegiance to its queen is absolute. Bewitched by her pheromones, the drones will do anything to serve their matriarch – rush into a blaze, dive into a chasm, sacrifice their bodies in her defense. Human commanders can only dream of such unconditional loyalty.
reward_tree_arachas_title;Arachas Queen
reward_tree_ardal_chest_1;Ardal aep Dahy played an important role in aiding Emhyr's seizure of the throne from the Usurper. He had hoped the young, inexperienced emperor—beholden to a debt of gratitude—would serve as loyal puppet. Yet once it became obvious that Emhyr would never bend to aep Dahy's will, he immediately began plotting a conspiracy for his overthrow – all while maintaining an unwavering ritual of fawning compliments and dutiful smiles.
reward_tree_ardal_chest_2;When preparations for the Second Northern War were underway, aep Dahy was initially assigned to lead Army Group "West". However, this did little to please the duke, for in fact he wasn't at all eager to prove his strength against the likes of Foltest and Vizimir. Instead, he pulled a few strings to be sent to the eastern front where he'd stand against Demavend and the gods-forsakened backwaters of Lyria and Rivia, ruled by a certain Queen Meve...
reward_tree_ardal_chest_3;At first, the invasion proceeded according to plan. The Nilfgaardian legions under aep Dahy's command swiftly overpowered Lyria and Rivia without spilling a drop of blood, due in large part to an act of northern treachery. The Aedirnians were consequently caught off guard by Nilfgaard's blitz offensive and, having failed to establish their defenses, capitulated within a fortnight. Looking out over the burning fields and villages from the ramparts of Aldersberg, Ardal aep Dahy smiled with pride. He had every confidence that this very fortress would forever bear the legacy of his triumph.
reward_tree_ardal_story_pt1;To call the Nilfgaardian imperial court a nest of vipers would be, quite frankly, an understatement. Simply in order to keep one's head, one must display exceptional measures of ruthlessness and cunning. To become Emhyr's right hand...  Well now, that would require relinquishing any remaining dregs of conscience.
reward_tree_ardal_story_pt2;Ardal aep Dahy fulfilled all the qualifications. He diligently analyzed everything from courtly intrigues to the war against the Nordlings as if it all were a game of chess. The idea that any given pawn might be a real, human life was never worthy of even an afterthought.
reward_tree_ardal_story_pt3;The blade which hangs from Ardal aep Dahy's waist, with its studded rubies and blunt edge, served a purely ceremonial purpose. Though that did not mean that Ardal was an weak adversary. On the contrary, he simply had others fight his battles for him.
reward_tree_ardal_story_pt4;From the nearest hilltop vantage point, far from the horrific melee of flesh and steel, Ardal aep Dahy commanded his legions via messengers, grimacing in disgust at the bloodcurdling screams of Nordlings crushed and broken beneath Nilfgaardian cavalry.

reward_tree_arnjolf_chest_1;Arnjolf numbered among the Disgraced – a band of Skelligan warriors guilty of a crime so vile that the only suitable punishment is exile from the Isles. But one path to regaining their honor remained: death in battle without armor against a worthy foe. And if the misdeed proved especially sinister, he was to be denied his weapon as well. Arnjolf reserved the right to wield his axes – blades he washed in blood at every opportunity.
reward_tree_arnjolf_chest_2;Arnjolf's body was covered with tattoos. The right shoulder bore his criminal sentence as delivered by Clan Brokvar's Council of Elders. The left shoulder bore the name of the father he slew. He marked his back with tallies for the years he'd spent in exile. Finally, upon his brow, a knife-carving of a rune with a simple message for enemy archers: "Aim here."
reward_tree_arnjolf_chest_3;The Disgraced once earned coin as blades-for-hire across the Continent. They seemed the ideal soldiers: modest fees, fought like frenzied bears, and exhibited no fear nor pain. Though, often after a hard-won battle, the Disgraced would suddenly charge at the nearest ally – frustrated at having emerged with their lives yet again. As their reputation spread, only the most desperate invited the Disgraced into their ranks...
reward_tree_arnjolf_story_pt1;Arnjolf's childhood was a happy one: hearthside tales were told by mum, longboats were whittled from logs, and children's games were played... That is, until that fateful day when his estranged father, Ulrik, returned home.
reward_tree_arnjolf_story_pt2;Ulrik had vanished before Arnjolf was born. The Nilfgaardians intercepted his longship, their whole crew put in chains. Six years passed before he managed to escape... Yet by then, the Ulrik of the past was already gone.
reward_tree_arnjolf_story_pt3;Ulrik jumped on any excuse to erupt in a rage, especially if he'd been drinking – and by gods did he drink. His pent-up anger often boiled over onto his wife and children. He beat, and pulled, and slapped with his bare hands. Well, at least that's how it started...
reward_tree_arnjolf_story_pt4;Ulfa, the youngest son, lost his life under his father's axe handle. Agrid, his wife, committed suicide. The night after her funeral, Arnjolf settled his accounts with his father... Later, now branded as one of the Disgraced, he abandoned Skellige's shores.

reward_tree_bear_2_story_pt1;It is often said that all the witchers from the Bear School are huge, broad-shouldered and bearded fellows. Ivo of Belhaven, however, did not quite fit this pattern. While he did have a beard, his posture and agility made him more fit to be a Cat or a Viper. Ironically, this made his character perfectly fit to the Bear School…
reward_tree_bear_2_story_pt2;Bears are loners, known for their reluctance towards the company of other witchers, and some might say that Ivo excelled in this field. It already started during his training in Haern Caduch. He did not like other students, to put it mildly. One could even call it hate at first sight. This cost Ivo plenty... Many wounds, much pain, and a lot of lost blood. Bigger sparring partners didn’t show him mercy during training. Yet the fight was always matched and Ivo would pay them back in their own coin.\nBlood for blood.
reward_tree_bear_2_story_pt3;The paths of new Bears parted once their training was over. Later, they would avoid each other as much as possible. Ivo was no different. He didn’t show any interest for the fate of the others, even when the angry mob chased witchers from Haern Caduch. This had nothing to do with anger or animosity, the mutations successfully neutralized such pointless feelings in him Ivo just didn’t care about others.\nThe only thing important was that he would get by.
reward_tree_bear_2_story_pt4;Of course, from time to time, Ivo would run into another witcher.\nOne such occasion was quite memorable. He crossed paths a Bear he knew from the school. The second witcher’s name was Junod, and just like Ivo, he assumed the sobriquet 'of Belhaven'. However, unlike Ivo, he did not come from Belhaven. When asked about the choice, he replied with refreshing candor, that he just liked the sound of the name – and, since he did not expect the smaller Bear to live very long, he did not have any qualms to steal his sobriquet.\nIronically, a couple of years later Ivo heard about Junod's death. And felt…\nNothing, actually.

reward_tree_bear_avatar_chest_1;Vernon Roche never graduated the officers' academy, nor did ever bury his nose in the chronicles of bygone wars. He acquired his experience, rather, by drunken brawls in dark alleys and smokey taverns. Had Foltest never seen something in him and pulled him from the gutter, his fate may have turned out differently altogether.
reward_tree_bear_avatar_chest_2;The Blue Stripes special forces unit was created to pacify the Scoia'tael prescence in Temeria. Its beginnings were difficult as few soldiers were eager to hunt elves in the forest. Rather than accept a slow stream of volunteers, Vernon decided to enlist prisoners – deserters, swindlers, and bandits included. Most perished quickly, pierced by the silent arrows of the Squirrels... Leaving only the most hardiest and craftiest whoresons in his ranks.
reward_tree_bear_avatar_chest_3;Many claim they would do anything for their homeland, but when push comes to shove, these noble pledges often fall short. Vernon Roche proved a stark exception, willing to make any sacrifice for Temeria. Thus, when Nilfgaard occupied the kingdom, he refused to hang up his sword. And even though his squad numbered just a shade over twenty, the Temerian partisans were never extinguished.
reward_tree_bear_avatar_story_pt1;Jaw clenched, eyes narrowed, frayed chaperon atop his head. His name uttered by non-humans to frighten their naughty children. This is Vernon Roche, commander of the Blue Stripes elite special forces unit.

reward_tree_bear_avatar_story_pt3;Roche had the lives of countless enemies on his conscience. Many even who had raised their arms in surrender, no doubt. After all, the Blue Stripes take no prisoners...
reward_tree_bear_avatar_story_pt4;Though Vernon Roche had locked swords with Kaedwenis, Aedirnians, and Redanians, he despised none more than the Scoia'tael... And the feeling was mutual.

reward_tree_bear_border_chest_1;Queen Meve of Lyria and Rivia once encountered a witcher from the School of the Bear. His name was Ivo. His dark complexion suggested he originally hailed from the warm climate of the Continent's southern regions. Whereas, the bluntness with which he responded to the queen's questions suggested he rarely conversed with heads of state...
reward_tree_bear_border_chest_2;A witcher from the School of the Bear once ventured into Toussaint. Junod of Belhaven was his name – as big as a mountain, with a beard that would put a dwarf elder to shame. He accepted a contract to slay a monster that dwelled in the caverns beneath Marcescent Forest. Alas, he was never seen again...
reward_tree_bear_border_chest_3;Just where is the School of the Bear? Some say hidden amidst the Slopes. Others argue it's found farther south, beyond the Amell Mountains. In fact, no one truly knows. And it's no surprise that Bear witchers have kept their whereabouts a secret, for the slaughter of the Wolf and Cat schools was known far and wide...
reward_tree_bear_border_story_pt1;The School of the Bear... Little is known about it, yet one look at their custom armor reveals telling details of the witchers who wear it. A hardy quilted gambeson, heavy mail extending to the knees, plate armor spaulders to protect the shoulders...
reward_tree_bear_border_story_pt2;A witcher equipped in such gear would not leap from raking claws, nor sidestep a beast's gnashing fangs. There is no need, for he can endure the blows... And ensure a short distrance from which he can exact his revenge.
reward_tree_bear_border_story_pt3;Unlike witchers from the Wolf School – who possess strong bonds of friendship and brotherhood – those from the Bear School prefer a solitary lifestyle, away from the company of other witchers. Should they encounter others on the path, however, rarely does it end without bloodshed.
reward_tree_bear_border_story_pt4;Bear witchers often travel to the Skellige Isles – and this should come as no surprise. For the islands have no shortage of monsters and the witchers get along rather well with the similarly brash, bearded locals...
reward_tree_bear_border_title;Season of the Bear
reward_tree_bran_chest_1;Bran's closest advisor and confidant was his wife, Birna. During banquets, she always sat at his side, silent, nearly unnoticeable in the bustle. She could recall every uttered rumor, every knowing wink, every raised eyebrow. Then later, in the bear skin-adorned bed of the royal bedchamber, she would whisper into her husband's ear all that she had learned...
reward_tree_bran_chest_2;Despite Birna's repeated requests, Bran refused to champion their son, Svanrige, as rightful heir to the throne. He believed if the boy truly deserved the crown, he'd earn it without the king's intercession. If found unworthy, so be it. Bran found the Continent's long history of dynastic rule preposterous. Birna, on the other hand, could not be persuaded to feel the same...
reward_tree_bran_chest_3;Bran lived a long life – a very long life. When, just after his eightieth birthday, his hands began to tremble and his thoughts began to wander mid-sentence, he set out with a small hunting party. Wearing only delicate linens and armed with only a knife, he departed for An Skellig in search of a bear... And an honorable death.
reward_tree_bran_story_pt1;They say it is easier to tame the seas crashing against Skellige's shores than the Skelligers themselves. Yet Bran did just that. He united the isles and the clans behind him – and long ruled with an iron fist.
reward_tree_bran_story_pt2;What was his secret? How did he succeed when others failed? Was it courage? Cunning? Intimidation? No, nothing of the sort. Bran tapped into a power previously unknown to the isles' inhabitants – compromise.
reward_tree_bran_story_pt3;When others would reach for ax and bow, Bran invited his rivals to banquet. With honey-sweet words, purses laden with coin, and barrels heavy with mead, it proved difficult to disagree with Skellige's king for long.
reward_tree_bran_story_pt4;Despite never slaying an ice giant or raiding the City of Golden Towers, Bran is remembered as a truly great ruler. Though not a hero in his own right, he delivered peace to the Isles, ushering in a period of growth and prosperity for the next generation of Skellige's champions.

reward_tree_brouver_chest_1;Brouver Hoog would happily sever all contact between Mahakam and the rest of the world. He sees other races as a threat to centuries-old dwarven traditions and culture, in constant danger of being subsumed beneath the thinly veiled guise of assimilation. For this reason, daily life in this mountainous region is tightly controlled. The Council of Clans issues decrees that regulate even the minutest of matters. Suspenders – admissible or not? May folk eat carp just after it has been prepared, or must its bed of jelly first congeal? Is playing the ocarina in line with the stalwart traditions of the dwarven race, or is it a nefarious import from the rotting, decadent culture of humans? And if the former, has it in the meanwhile become simply uncouth?
reward_tree_brouver_chest_2;Elder Brouver Hoog changes his mind about as often as he shaves – which is never. Rulers of the human domains quickly realized they would not buy his favor with fancy gifts, nor intimidate him to action with fanciful threats. The sole way an elder as stubborn as Brouver can be influenced is through the invocation of some long-forgotten dwarven law or some precedent upon which to base one’s plea. Many a king has rushed to fabricate some scrap of an ancient code allegedly lost to time, so as to call upon it when debating the Mahakaman leader…
reward_tree_brouver_chest_3;While mages throughout the Continent worry continually about the prophesied danger that is the White Frost, Brouver Hoog impatiently awaits its arrival. For far beneath the earth’s surface, in the mountains’ very bowels, the dwarves have hollowed out whole cities, where temperatures are stable, and mushrooms grow plentifully without need of any sunlight. So even should the Frost encase the Continent for centuries, the dwarves will be just fine. Then, after the Great Thaw, they will emerge into a world freed of the human scourge.
reward_tree_brouver_story_pt1;Brouver Hoog, Mahakam’s elder-in-chief, is quite the controversial figure amongst nonhumans. Some see him as the Elder Races’ last chance for survival, while others perceive in him solely cowardly traitor. How did the voices come to be so divided? To find out, we will need to venture back more than two centuries…
reward_tree_brouver_story_pt2;It was around that time that the elves embarked upon a final, desperate attempt to rid the Continent of humans. A messenger arrived in Mahakam. With an impassioned voice, he spoke of the need for solidarity between the Elder Races. Brouver Hoog listened… then promptly threw him out of dwarven homeland and slammed the gates shut behind him.
reward_tree_brouver_story_pt3;While humans and elves tore at each other’s throats, Brouver waited. Ten, twenty, thirty years… A whole century passed before Mahakam re-opened its doors. Eagerly, the dwarves awaited the first arrivals from the valleys… and any news of the war.
reward_tree_brouver_story_pt4;The elves had suffered total defeat. Their domains had been reduced to utter ruin, and their youth had bled to death on battlefields stretching from the Dragon Mountains all the way to Angren. Had Brouver Hoog answered their call those centuries past, the dwarves would surely have shared the elves’ fate. Thanks to the elder-in-chief’s foresight, Mahakam had flourished in the meantime… though not unburdened, a measure of guilt weighing upon it.

reward_tree_calanthe_chest_1;As history tells us, Calanthe was the last to ever reign as Queen of Cintra. During the First Nilfgaardian War, Emhyr var Emreis moved to assimilate the neighboring kingdom into his empire. The Lioness of Cintra, as she was fondly known, defended her ancestral home with great ferocity – enduring grave wounds herself. Yet, sensing the castle's immininent ruin, she ordered her courtiers to deliver her a knife with which she could take her own life. None dared comply and play part in their queen's demise. Alas, their defiance was in vain, for Calanthe then simply threw herself from the tower's highest window.
reward_tree_calanthe_chest_2;Sadly, the queen's body was never found—likely trampled beyond recognition into blood-soaked mud by Nilfgaardian heavy infantry. Following the war, two glorious monuments were erected in her honor: one in Skellige, where she was symbolically laid to rest beside her beloved husband, and the other beneath the Cintra Castle by the request of Emhyr var Emreis, her conqueror. It seems—for reasons likely known only to him—the Nilfgaardian emperor felt bitter remorse over the queen's death...
reward_tree_calanthe_chest_3;Calanthe's veins carried the blood of an ancient Aen Elle line—that of Lara Dorren, one of the Aen Saevherne, or elven sages as they are commonly known. Though the Lioness of Cintra didn't inherit the magical talents of the elder blood, such an affinity did reveal itself in her daughter, Pavetta, and thereafter in her granddaughter, Cirilla. Yet given Calanthe's infamous temper, perhaps such a fate was for the best. To think what she would have been capable of had she been versed in the arcane magical arts...
reward_tree_calanthe_story_pt1;Calanthe—or Calanthe Fiona Riannon, to be precise—was oft referred to under two monikers. Throughout the Continent she was known as the "Lioness of Cintra," and on the Skellige Isles as "Ard Rhena"—that is, the "High Queen." Both names fit her better than even the finest pair of silken gloves.
reward_tree_calanthe_story_pt2;Calanthe proved as valiant as she was stern. At the mere sight of her, boisterous warriors would fall utterly silent, and even the most vainglorious counts stooped low in bow. Few dared to act against her will, and fewer still would repeat their mistake.
reward_tree_calanthe_story_pt3;Calanthe had always wished to rule on her own, hence her longtime aversion toward marriage. Yet when she finally decided to wed, the well of eager suitors had run dry. With eyes like green ice, her fearsome gaze did little to melt the hearts of young princes...
reward_tree_calanthe_story_pt4;In the end, Calanthe walked down the aisle on two occasions. Her first husband, Roegner de Salm, gave her an heiress; the second, Eist Tuirseach — true love. It could have made for a beautiful tale... If not for its bitter end.

reward_tree_calveit_chest_1;As a young man, Jan Calveit served in the Magne Division, which was charged with the defense of the Empire's eastern border along the Tir Tochair mountain range. During an expedition against a crew of nomad outlaws roaming the Korath Desert, his unit fell victim to an ambush. Calveit alone escaped with his life. For weeks he wandered the hot sands under a brutal sun, wounded and exhausted. Yet, he eventually returned home... Though forever a changed man.
reward_tree_calveit_chest_2;A deep scar extends diagonally across Emperor Calveit's face. Despite repeated offers from his court mages to hide or remove the mark, the emperor always adamantly refused. "Those who do not reflect upon their mistakes are doomed to repeat them," he asserted. Indeed, it is impossible to forget one's past missteps when they stare back at you in the mirror.
reward_tree_calveit_chest_3;Jan Calveit preferred to observe battle seated in a throne placed at the edge of the battlefield. Even as flaming arrows whistled by and falling stones carved out craters in the earth around him, he would never stand and flee. "Our fates are written in the stars," he would say. "And my day has not yet come."
reward_tree_calveit_story_pt1;Jan Calveit showed great interest in several fields of study, including medicine and astrology. His critics often scoffed at the impracticality of his academic pursuits. One day, they learned just how wrong they were to doubt his investment...
reward_tree_calveit_story_pt2;Calveit founded a medical university in Vicovaro. One of the academy's departments quickly became notorious, for it was said that its scholars – in contrast to most medical practitioners – preferred working with the dead rather than the living...

reward_tree_cat_2_story_chest;Brehen never considered saving the princess. Even if the myths were true⁠—and he seriously doubted it⁠—breaking the curse would be a lot more work and certainly more dangerous. The risk just wasn’t worth the reward. Besides, witchers were made for killing and Brehen had no intention of exhausting himself any more than he had to. The bounty would still stand if he claimed self-defence and no one else would be around to prove otherwise. So, on the next full moon, with weapons prepped and decoctions consumed, the Cat of Iello crept into the vaults beneath the forsaken palace, ready to end the murderous reign of the striga once and for all. Upon seeing her muscular physique, deadly-sharp claws, and hideous form, Brehen showed no fear nor concern. On the contrary, he scoffed at the sight of the cursed princess and sneered mockingly: “You’re not my first royal.” Alas, she would be his last.
reward_tree_cat_2_story_pt1;As a member of the Feline witchers, Brehen’s training focused on speed, precision, and agility—a skill set perfect for the nefarious acts of assassination ofttimes connected to the School of the Cat. So, despite his versatility during combat, one could say the most flexible thing about Brehen was his morality... and they’d be right.
reward_tree_cat_2_story_pt2;Like most of his kin, Brehen was a rogue and an outcast. Prone to bouts of heightened emotion and erratic behaviour—attributed to the school’s warped mutation process—Brehen’s volatile nature was infamous. Mostly due to his hand in the massacre at the town of Iello, which forever branded him with the shady moniker: Cat of Iello.
reward_tree_cat_2_story_pt3;Upon travelling to Vizima—where he intended to claim the reward for curing King Foltest’s daughter of her monstrous curse—Brehen had a chance encounter with Geralt at The Wild Boar and Stag tavern. Believing the rival witcher was out to steal the bounty for himself, Brehen confronted the White Wolf. Whether it was confidence in his own fighting prowess, or the knowledge that Geralt was currently unarmed, Brehen attempted to coerce his opponent into a duel, declaring that only one of them would make it out alive.
reward_tree_cat_2_story_pt4;As luck would have it, a fight between the Cat of Iello and the Butcher of Blaviken would not take place. Instead, an impromptu delivery of Geralt’s swords shifted the dynamic of the situation, and Brehen’s confidence seemingly vanished along with his advantage. Not wanting to risk facing the Wolf’s fury on equal footing, the Cat conceded and vanished into the night, never to meet Geralt - nor any other witcher - ever again.

reward_tree_cat_avatar_chest_1;How was it that the fates of Geralt and Ciri – a witcher and a princess of Cintra – became forever intertwined? The Law of Surprise. After the witcher had lifted the curse afflicting Duny, the Urcheon of Erlenwald, he was asked what he desired as reward. Geralt replied, "That which you find at home, yet did not expect." Shortly thereafter, Duny would learn that his wife Pavetta was with child - Ciri. Though Geralt had no intention of encforcing the Law, it had simply become a matter of destiny...
reward_tree_cat_avatar_chest_2;A dark period of Ciri's life came when she joined a bandit gang known as the "Rats." Constantly on the run, exhausted, Ciri had found a semblance of refuge among the young, cutthroat outlaws. At first, she refused to kill as they did, though her reluctance wouldn't last long. To her own horror, she enjoyed killing - and she was good at it. Eventually, however, her comrades were slaughtered to the last. Ciri barely survived and was nursed back from the brink of death under the care of a hermit, Vysogota of Corvo. Had events turned out differently, who knows... Perhaps Ciri would be known today not as a heroine, but as a villain.
reward_tree_cat_avatar_chest_3;Before Cintra fell to ruin, as a young princess, Ciri would spend her holidays on the Skellige Isles at the family estate of Clan an Craite. It was there with the jarl's children that she learned to ice-skate. As fate would have it, this skill would later save her life when confronted by Nilfgaardian assassins on the frozen waters of Tarn Mira. In a dense, milky fog, the assailants could only hear the eerie scrape of her skates, coming from all directions... Followed swiftly by blood-chilling screams of surprise and pain as they fell one by one to her blade.
reward_tree_cat_avatar_story_pt1;Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon. The Lion Cub of Cintra, Swallow, Zirael, Falka, Child of the Elder Blood, the Lady of Time and Space. An impressive collection of monikers for an impressive woman.
reward_tree_cat_avatar_story_pt2;Daughter to Pavetta and Duny, the young princess enjoyed an early childhood of royal splendor. But then everything changed... Cintra was engulfed in flames and violence, Ciri forced to flee from family and home...
reward_tree_cat_avatar_story_pt3;Eventually, she found a new home in Kaer Morhen, a witchers' fortress and seat of the School of the Wolf. There, under the watchful eye of Geralt of Rivia, she began a grueling training regimen. And it's good that she did, because this peace of her stay there would not last forever... And it couldn't, for after all, the Elder Blood flowed through her veins.
reward_tree_cat_avatar_story_pt4;Due to her lineage, Ciri was endowed with extraordinary gift - the ability to traverse time and space. However, she quickly began to see her ability not as a blessing, but as a curse. For many obsessively coveted her power and sought to exploit it at any cost...

reward_tree_cat_border_chest_1;Members of the School of the Cat are ill-famed due to their penchant for frenzy and bloodlust in the heat of battle. Even when their enemies capitulate, beg for mercy... They never stop killing. The inhabitants of Honorton learned this truth in the most brutal fashion. Instead of rewarding a Feline witcher for a contract fulfilled, they withheld their coin and skewered him with pitchfork instead. Gaetan – so was the monster slayer's name – survived the treacherous blow, yet the bloodshed did not stop there... The witcher slaughtered the entire village – men, women, children, the sick and feeble... It mattered not who had a hand in his betrayal. Only one survived the massacre, a young lass named Millie...
reward_tree_cat_border_chest_2;What makes witchers from Cat school so cruel and impetuous? It is widely believed to be a side effect of their mutations. While emotions are suppressed in other witchers, the alchemical cocktail used in the School of the Cat had apparently intensified them. Before the error that tainted the formula could be corrected, it was already too late – a new generation of Feline witchers was born. A generation who would seize control of the School... And had no intention of changing the formula.
reward_tree_cat_border_chest_3;Although Ciri trained at the School of the Wolf, she wore a Feline witcher's medallion. She had claimed it from the lifeless body of infamous bounty hunter Leo Bonhart. Bonhart had boasted that he was one of few to ever best a witcher in combat – and several at that – as evidenced by the three silver medallions fastened to his belt. The swordmaster never claimed a fourth, however, as Ciri spilled his blood over the cold cobblestones of Stygga Castle.
reward_tree_cat_border_story_pt1;Each witcher school holds a unique reputation. Bears - sulkers and firebrands. Wolves - traditionalists. And Cats? Prone to use steel swords more often than silver.
reward_tree_cat_border_story_pt2;Unlike other witchers, those from the School of the Cat were not committed to a position of neutrality. As a result, they were often hired as spies and assassins. And it's no wonder – assassinating a nobleman usually paid better than slaying a drowner.
reward_tree_cat_border_story_pt3;The ill repute of Feline witchers became increasingly notorious in royal circles. After a time, kings and queens began to fear in earnest for their lives. For the witchers, however, this came not as a point of pride, but one of concern, for rulers do not like to feel threatened...
reward_tree_cat_border_story_pt4;One day, an army marched onto the grounds of the School of the Cat. For three days the blood-soaked slaughter persisted, but eventually every last defending witcher perished. As for those who were not present during the attack?

reward_tree_cc_chest_1;Eltibald derived his prophecies not only from his observations of celestial bodies, but also from inscriptions found on sepulchers and menhirs of the Wozgor and Dauk peoples – human cultures considered among the Continent's most ancient and mysterious. Ultimately, he came to discover the Crimson Curse after examining sacrificial stone slabs of the Svalblod cult in Skellige. According to the isles' inhabitants, the cruel, deity-like being had already been vanquished once and for all. Alas, they could not have been further from the truth...
reward_tree_cc_chest_2;Of course, intelligent monsters had known of the Crimson Curse far earlier than humans. Higher vampires, knockers, sylvans... All sensed the red moon's approach—and all awaited it with eager anticipation. For they knew such an opportunity to settle their grudges against humankind may never again present itself.
reward_tree_cc_chest_3;Historians have long been fascinated by a particular conundrum: how is it that humans rule over the Continent, from the Dragon Mountains to the Great Sea, while monsters – whether werebbubb or godling, fiend or leshen – possess the greater strength? That humans to this day force these powerful beasts deeper into dense woodlands and mountain caves? Some scholars argue that the success of mankind lies in its capacity to build complex social structures, whereas monsters are blindly driven by their appetite for blood. Ever with the sharp intellect and loose tongue, Regis once mused over the question with his close friend, Dettlaff van der Eretein. Regis could not have known, however, how his words that fateful day would forever shift the course of history...
reward_tree_cc_story_pt1;Since the dawn of time, people have peered with curious eyes into the night sky. Among the stars, they've sought signs from the gods, even prophecies of the future. For some, it has worked—though often at the price of losing their minds.
reward_tree_cc_story_pt2;One such clairvoyant was a mage by the name of Eltibald, who foretold the impending arrival of the Black Sun. His next work was meant to herald an even graver misfortune... Alas, he passed away before the manuscript could be completed.

While some have power thrust upon them⁠—bound by duty and obligation⁠—others harbor the deep-seated drive to claim greatness and rise above the rest. Yet most would-be leaders, void of favorable heritage, must acquire such positions via brute force and bloodshed. After all, it's impossible to keep one's hands clean while leading a Scoia'tael commando or overseeing the unruly and violent "organizations" of Novigrad. And woe to those who try to control monsters without inexorable displays of dominance. When any hint of benevolence is viewed as weakness, a leader must ensure they strike constant fear into the hearts of all, friend and foe alike.
reward_tree_cd1_leadership_story_chest_2;Terror-infused carnage indeed makes for a rousing legacy, and bloodlust and aggression⁠—as the natives of Skellige have demonstrated time and again⁠—can undoubtedly prove useful. In the short term, at least. However, real longevity of power blossoms from a more calm and calculated approach to leadership: Why fling oneself into the fray like a frenzied hound when one can simply take a moment to stand back, analyze the situation, and act accordingly. For intelligence and patience have won far more battles than hot-headed fury, with far fewer casualties. It takes but a glimpse at the Nilfgaardian expanse to see just how efficient shrewd diplomacy can be⁠—albeit with an ample supply of treachery thrown in for good measure.
reward_tree_cd1_leadership_story_chest_3;When it comes to the loyalty of one's subjects, there's no denying that fear makes for an excellent motivator. Yet, support found in such a way tends to be fleeting and often dissipates at the first sign of vulnerability. An uprising here, a coup there⁠—brutality breeds brutality, it has long been known. In fact, many would argue respect and admiration build sturdier foundations and command far stronger patronage; a notion embraced by many of the Northern Realms' rulers for centuries; for they've long affirmed that fearmongering and coercion pale in comparison to the steadfast devotion of truly faithful vassals.
reward_tree_cd1_leadership_title;Stalwart Leadership
reward_tree_cd2_chest_pt1;One need only glance at the history of the upper echelons of Nilfgaardian aristocracy, or the dog-eat-dog hierarchies of the Novigradian underworld, to understand plainly that those who rise to the top are often those willing to do what others wouldn’t even dare dream of. When one is free from the restraints of compassion and conscience, almost anything is possible, it would seem. Yet, those who play such dangerous games should be wary, for ambitious men—like moths scorched by the fateful allure of a flame—often dance with death during their ascent to the top. And thus, all those eager to realize such lofty ambitions will do well to remember the adage: the higher one climbs, the harder one falls.
reward_tree_cd2_chest_pt2;Indeed, the right word in the right ear at the right time can sway the course of history. And so too can an inspirational speech⁠—one, say, that captures the hearts and minds of a ragtag bunch of outcasts, stirring their spirits and forging in them an enduring bond of loyalty and respect. Yet, one should not mistake an idea with its execution. Often enough, those who talk more do less. In an attempt to seize glories yet earned, words can effortlessly spew forth from a zealous tongue, allowing visions of grandeur to usurp the tangible act of pursuing the task at hand. Thus, the legends of prominent leaders are seldom forged by words alone; instead solidified by the collective acknowledgement of their deeds and accomplishments. It is a mere irony that such feats are often only learned about through texts on a page, or by word of mouth.
reward_tree_cd2_chest_pt3;In life, all have a part to play. While most are assigned lifelong roles, stuck with whatever ill-fated hand they’re dealt, some are fortunate—or wily⁠—enough to shape their own performance. To recast their persona until the slipper fits, so to speak. Throughout the Continent, many figures have forged new identities for themselves in order to pursue a grander purpose. Or to secure more power and wealth, at least. It has often been argued by savants of sociopolitical studies that most of the common folk are inexorably drawn to those who embody their ideals of success⁠—those that exude, often publicly, the quality of life so desperately sought after by the rank and file. And when the average life is a drab existence of misery and misfortune, who can blame them for seeking a beacon of hope amid the darkness. Whether or not such a beacon is a facade… Well, that makes not the slightest bit of difference, for a solitary fantasy, if convincing enough, can transform a thousand realities.
reward_tree_cd2_story_pt1;The Continent has been wrought by the actions of countless leaders⁠—the virtuous and the villainous alike. Their accumulative deeds, both small and grand, good and bad, are etched into the texture of the land’s history, indubitably shaping the world as we now know it, for better or worse.
reward_tree_cd2_story_pt2;From commanders and conspirators to rulers and renegades, all leaders, from the righteous to the reprobate, know one simple truth: a world without change is a world left behind—for one cannot advance a society without first challenging the status quo.
reward_tree_cd2_story_pt3;Thus, a leader must incite change. And, for that, they must inspire. Uniting their people towards a common cause⁠—whether that be fame, fortune, or freedom—they must, through the strength found within a solidarity of purpose, turn grand visions into reality.
reward_tree_cd2_story_pt4;For, if one cannot make manifest their vision of a better world, if one’s unable to motivate their people, or command loyalty, or rouse change, then one⁠—no matter their position or power⁠—is simply no leader at all.

reward_tree_cleaver_chest_1;The non-humans of Novigrad knew all too well the city guard has no intention of improving their lot in life. In fact, they often do the exact opposite. For this reason, in non-human quarters of Novigrad, Carlo "Cleaver" Varese maintains order. Those who cooperate with Cleaver praise the protection he offers. But be warned, for those who refuse it are often never heard from again.
reward_tree_cleaver_chest_2;Cleaver prefers to conduct business in the city baths because it is difficult to smuggle in a blade under one's towel and, should negotiations call for a stronger hand, a bare-knuckle resolution works to Cleaver's advantage. With fists the size of rye loaves, the brawl and subesequent business arrangement often conclude in his favor.
reward_tree_cleaver_chest_3;Most dwarves who have decided to live amongst humans do their best to not stand out. They walk with their gaze cast down, their caps pulled over their eyes. But not Cleaver. With chest bared, tattoos and jewelry in full view, and his greased mohawk glistening in the sun, he's rather difficult to miss.
reward_tree_cleaver_story_pt1;Cleaver is actually a rather kind fellow. Truly. That is, of course, until you've said the wrong thing. Then he makes it quite clear just how he earned his moniker.
reward_tree_cleaver_story_pt2;Carlo Varese worked in a slaughterhouse as a young dwarf, becoming adept at butchering hogs. In time, a new truth dawned on him – slaughtering a pig isn't all that different than slaughtering a man.
reward_tree_cleaver_story_pt3;Those who stand in Cleaver's way, intentionally or otherwise, can expect to find themselves later at the bottom of the Pontar in pieces tiny enough to be swallowed up by river fish.

reward_tree_crach_chest_1;Due to the havoc wrought by his fleets in the Empire's coastal territories, Crach earned the moniker "Tirth ys Muire" – the Wild Boar of the Sea. Pleased with the new epithet, Crach decided to sculpt the bow of his drakkar into the likeness of raging boar's head. According to legend, they harvested the wood from Gedyneith, the sacred oak of Ard Skellig. The drakkar instilled fear into the hearts of enemies, for whenever they rammed into an enemy vessel, the wild boar's eyes would glow blood red...
reward_tree_crach_chest_2;Crach an Craite fathered two children – his son, Hjalmar, and his daughter, Cerys. When asked whom he would wish to see as heir and successor, he could only sigh, conflicted by his thoughts. Hjalmar reminded Crach of his younger self – ambitious, valiant, hungry for glory. An impressive warrior, yes... But a jarl? Cerys, on the other hand, possessed all the qualities required of a capable leader. But were the islanders prepared to follow the word of a woman? Only time would tell...
reward_tree_crach_chest_3;As a young man – his beard a rich auburn, his smile broad, the famed vanquisher of the Nilfgaardian armada – Crach stole the gaze of many women. Why, even the famous Yennefer of Vengerberg was enticed by Crach's charm. According to rumor, he asked for the sorceress' hand in marriage. In response, Yennefer smiled, kissed him on his brow... then opened a portal and disappeared from the Skellige Isles for nearly three decades.
reward_tree_crach_story_pt1;At a young age, Crach was foretold that he would one day clash with a foreign ruler, an enemy to Skellige, on the Isles' stormy, coastal seas. For his entire life, the head of Clan an Craite waited for that fateful day...
reward_tree_crach_story_pt2;Convinced the prophecy referred to the  Emperor of Nilfgaard, Crach constantly urged his fleet to remain watchful for black sails bearing the Golden Sun. He eagerly awaited the emperor's arrival, to look him in the eye before wresting the crown from his head.
reward_tree_crach_story_pt3;Years passed, then decades... Crach sank dozens of Nilfgaardian galleys, yet the emperor's feet remained on dry land. Apparently, he was troubled by matters more important than the taming the rocky isles.
reward_tree_crach_story_pt4;Crach became convinced the prophecy must have been misinterpreted. Resigned, he ceased his search for the great sea battle that was written for him in the stars. That is, until on Skellige's shores appeared the Naglfar – the ghostly drakkar commanded by the King of the Wild Hunt himself.

reward_tree_dana_chest_1;Until recent history, few mortals had ever laid eyes upon Dana Méadbh. It is said she once appeared only in spring or summer, and even then with no guarantee. Some claim she was most likely to be witnessed during the Feast of the Scythe, or Lammas, as the elves call it. She would join in to the harvest dance, even weave marigolds into maidens' braids. Though when the world is bound in ice, as well as in recent memory, Dana Méadbh has begun to appear more frequently... Alas, this is no reason to rejoice, for the Queen of the Fields is angry. Rather than show gratitude for nature's plentiful bounty, the world's inhabitants instead continue to tear and plunder away ever more. The time has come they were taught a lesson – one that shall be remembered for a long, long while.
reward_tree_dana_chest_2;Drawn more to dead rock than living plants and beasts, dwarves possess the weakest connection with nature. Despite this apparent lack of affinity, they too worship Dana Méadbh, yet call her by another name: Bloëmenmagde. They demonstrate their honor by laying wreaths of hops and jars of pickled fungi at a crossroads. None know whether Lyfia, as she is sometimes known, truly enjoys such offerings... But the knockers of the surrounding mountains certainly do.
reward_tree_dana_chest_3;Dana Méadbh sometimes takes the form of a ordinary woman, using her guise to live amongst mortals. She does not speak, as if mute, staying clear of the beaten path, yet observes all with a keen eye. In those villages where the peasantfolk do not weed the poppies and cornflowers from their fields of rye, where they treat their cows to the delight of carrots, Lyfia multiplies their bounty. Yet where peasants treat the land not as mother but slave, so comes the devastation of frost and hail...
reward_tree_dana_story_pt1;Sometimes, on a hot summer's day, you might spot the silhouette of a young woman in the heart of a birch grove, surrounded by dancing butterflies with a crown of flowers atop her head. The elves call her Dana Méadbh. To humans, she is Lyfia, or the Queen of the Fields.
reward_tree_dana_story_pt2;Not even the greatest of the elven sages know who – or what – she truly is. Some consider her a goddess, others – the forces of nature embodied. Though one thing is for certain: without her presence, the Continent would sit as a lifeless rock in the sea.
reward_tree_dana_story_pt3;It is Dana Méadbh who awakens plants and beasts at the advent of spring, who nurtures the buds of delicate flowers. Wherever she steps, the land bestows its bounty. Where she treads not, stalks snap, flowers wilt, and harvests wane.
reward_tree_dana_story_pt4;For a long time, Dana Méadbh refused to meddle in the affairs of mortals. She held love for all races. Yet the balance of the world was disturbed and Lyfia sought to restore it. By force, if necessary.

reward_tree_demavend_chest_1;Although all now are too young to recall, Demavend was once a strapping young man. Foltest himself would have envied the man's eagle-like profile. Maidens swooned when caught under the gaze of his piercing emerald eyes. But years of plenty have taken their toll. A plump belly and rosy cheeks show clearly that the king was never want for sumptuous food and drink. His saggy neck and hunched shoulders proved further that he preferred to command his armies from a silk-lined throne in place of a saddle...
reward_tree_demavend_chest_2;Demavend's hatred for elves was legendary. While Vizimir and Foltest fought the Squirrels out of necessity, the King of Aedirn hunted the rebels down with astonishing enthusiasm. Despite the fact that the war with Nilfgaard had nearly drained Aedirn's royal treasury, Demavend offered 50 ducats for every Scoia'tael head. Taking advantage of the lucrative bounty, Aedirnians often falsely accused and captured innocent elves and dwarves. Demavend was perfectly aware his subjects were exploiting the offer. And yet, he didn't seem bothered in the least...
reward_tree_demavend_chest_3;Under his crown, Demavend always wore a white cap embroidered with gold thread – undeterred even by the sweltering summer months. Why? It seems the vain king was ashamed of his retreating hairline. Many alchemists and barbers passed through his court, offering promises to restore the Aedirnian ruler's lustrous mane. Each of them, to the last, spent their remaining days in the Aldersberg dungeons for their failure – deprived of freedom... and their own scalps.
reward_tree_demavend_story_pt1;Demavend possessed many traits that predisposed the king for greatness. Well-educated, shrewd, cunning, a master of political intrigue. Unfortunately, he was also very, very impatient.
reward_tree_demavend_story_pt2;King Demavend was never satisfied with the present. He always looked to tomorrow, to the great feats of his future, shrugging off the mundane tasks of the court. Whilst his advisers bored him with the nuances of prudent fiscal policy, he quietly planned his next conquest...
reward_tree_demavend_story_pt3;Aedirn's neighbors learned quickly that Demavend could never be appeased with compromise. His kingdom expanded like dough baked in too small a bread pan, pushing and stretching in all directions. Not unlike the Nilfgaardian Empire...
reward_tree_demavend_story_pt4;When Nilfgaardian forces eventually crossed the Yaruga, a panicked fear struck deeply in all the rulers of the North. All except for King Demavend, that is. He rejoiced, for at last he would face an enemy worthy of Aedirn's might! Of course... His jubilation would not last long.

reward_tree_dettlaff_chest_1;Witchers used to classify higher vampires as a distinct species. However, their logic was not fully sound, for each possesses its own unique character and abilities. Regis, for example, was a loner endowed with extraordinary intellect. Dettlaff, by contrast, seemed destined to lead a flock. Lower forms of vampires such as katakans, ekimmaras, and bruxae answered his every call without delay. The inhabitants of Beauclair would quickly learn the disastrous consequences of such overwhelming control...
reward_tree_dettlaff_chest_2;Perhaps the most distinctive piece of Dettlaff's attire is a jewel-encrusted brooch crafted in the shape of a moth – a gift bestowed to him by Regis. Dettlaff viewed the token as a symbol of his connection with the night. Regis, however, held a different association in mind. He knew his friend, driven primal urges, would – like a moth – always be drawn back to the light. Even if that meant he would one day be consumed by the flames.
reward_tree_dettlaff_chest_3;After Dettlaff slayed four knights of Toussaint guilty of despicable acts, he became known to Toussaintois as the Beast of Beauclair. Sentenced to death for the killings, the Toussaint court summoned a witcher to track and kill the unknown monster. Dettlaff could but watch on in utter disbelief, for the widely adored Duchess Anna Henrietta has condemned dozens to the scaffold for much, much less! Even the monster slayer called to Toussaint had more innocent lives on his conscience than the alleged beast he was commissioned to kill! This was the tipping point. Dettlaff decided to no longer adhere to the laws of men. He would instead impose upon them the vampiric code of honor – a system founded on the harshest punishments...
reward_tree_dettlaff_story_pt1;Dettlaff once tried to live among people in peace. He muzzled his bloodlust, mastered the Common Speech, and perfected the basics of courtly etiquette. Over time, he began to make friends of humans... And in one in particular, he found a lover.
reward_tree_dettlaff_story_pt2;His beloved's name was Syanna. Dettlaff's love for her was absolute. He was prepared to do any and all for her. In fact, Syanna made ample use of his love-driven dedication... That is, until the day she vanished without a trace or a word.
reward_tree_dettlaff_story_pt3;Syanna likely assumed that Dettlaff would swallow the bitter pill of rejection like all her lovers before him. Alas, the reasoning of vampires works differently than in men. And so, too, did Dettlaff's fury burn more fiercely.
reward_tree_dettlaff_story_pt4;Dettlaff felt scorned not only by Syanna, but by the entire human race. He took them all for traitors, hypocrites, and deceivers. Unfortunately, even but a brief look back on the Continent's history shows us he is not altogether wrong...

reward_tree_dire_rat_chest;Some say that the Wererat is just an urban legend. Others swear that they have seen him in the sewers – just not in one particular city. So one could get the impression that the humanoid rat liked to live in the sewers of every large human community on the Continent. Or that there were simply more of them. Wererats, that is. There was even a rumor, that the people who lived through the epidemic are not humans anymore.\nAt least not everyday.
reward_tree_dire_rat_story_pt1;Rats can be found everywhere. At least everywhere, where people live.
reward_tree_dire_rat_story_pt2;For example the itinerant rat (rattus nordlicus, according to the Oxenfurt classification) along with humans, has colonized the entire Continent, and most likely, also the lands beyond the sea. One could think that rats, and not the dogs, are human's best friend.\nNothing could be more wrong.
reward_tree_dire_rat_story_pt3;Rats are the harbingers of human misfortune. They destroy property, eat the supplies and carry diseases. Their tiny claws and teeth can prove deadlier than the largest war machines. While they will not level an entire city, they can easily kill all its inhabitants… All it takes is one infected animal. One tiny cut that brings the worst for humans.\nThe plague.
reward_tree_dire_rat_story_pt4;No one can foresee the town and time that the Plague Maiden will send her rats to. Similarly, no one can tell which disease they will spread. What will the symptoms be? When you hear the stories about the dreadful mutations among the infected, who nevertheless still lived…\nDeath seems to be the merciful option.
reward_tree_draconic_avatar_chest_1;The identity of Saskia's mother remains a mystery, though evidence suggests she was Myrgtabrakke – a dragon once the target of a hunting expedition led by King Niedamir of Caingorn. Who took part in the campaign to slay her? The question, rather, is who did not! The party included Yarpen Zigrin and his dwarves, Eyck of Denesle, Yennefer of Vengerberg, Dorregaray of Vole, the Crinfrid Reavers, and even the legendary Geralt of Rivia himself... And yet, somehow, Myrgtabrakke lived. How, you ask? It's unknown for certain, for none on the expedition ever wished to speak of it...
reward_tree_draconic_avatar_chest_2;It was Saskia's dream to establish a new kingdom in the Pontar Valley, at the junction of Kaedwen and Aedirn. All races – elves, dwarves, humans, halflings, and gnomes – were to live there in peace, free from prejudice and discrimination. A beautiful dream, indeed... Yet extremely difficult to realize.
reward_tree_draconic_avatar_chest_3;After reading Saskia's spirited, impassioned speeches, it's difficult to walk away without an impression that she was unusually... naive. Would an experienced politician believe that a peasant uprising could defeat King Henselt's army? That the Scoia'tael would abandon the forest in order to defend the lives of humans and dwarves? That the Lodge of Sorceresses would provide aid with no ulterior motive? And yet... Such dreamers are needed, for it is only they who can change the world for the better.
reward_tree_draconic_avatar_story_pt1;Saskia held several monikers. Queen of the Pontar Valley, the Virgin of Aedirn, the Dragonslayer. Hmm, well... In retrospect, we know that at least two of these titles were undeserved.
reward_tree_draconic_avatar_story_pt2;For now, let us leave matters of the bedchamber left to unspoken speculation and focus on her title of "Dragonslayer." In fact, she had never slayed a dragon... Nor had she ever an intent to take her own life.
reward_tree_draconic_avatar_story_pt3;Yes, yes, you understood that correctly. Saskia – or rather Saesenthessis, as that was her full name – was none other than a golden dragon, a being able to assume any form...
reward_tree_draconic_avatar_story_pt4;But that begs the question... Why assume human form? Why meddle in human affairs? In all likelihood, she inherited her fondness for people from her father, Villentretenmerth.

reward_tree_draconic_border_chest_1;As surely as the sun rises with each day, people deathly afraid of dragons. That is... With exception of the Zerrikanians. Should you believe the tales of travelers returning from the Continent's far east, the folk of Zerrikania make sacrifices to the reptiles and erect temples in their honor. What's more, they consider dragons the embodiment of virtue and beauty. Any who raises sword or bow against one shall suffer punishment of the greatest severity. What truth can be found in such stories, however, is difficult to discern...
reward_tree_draconic_border_chest_2;Dragons are a rare sight on the Continent, yet accounts of destruction wrought by the beasts still widely circulates. When an expert arrives at the scene of an attack – a witcher, as is often the case – they often conclude it's not the work of a dragon. Far more commonly, a slyzard, forktail, or wyvern is the culprit. Rumor has it, golden dragons find such comparisons highly offensive...
reward_tree_draconic_border_chest_3;The most famous of dragons was likely Villentretenmerth – known in his human form as Borch Three Jackdaws. Unlike others of his species, he had sympathy for humans and enjoyed spending time with them. This was especially true in the comfort of taverns and inns, the tables heavy with hearty fare, in the company of troubadors and the fierce female warriors of Zerrikania...
reward_tree_draconic_border_story_pt1;Green, red, black, white, gold... There are several dragon varieties. They differ in color, of course, but also in size, intelligence, and their abilities. So, in what way are they alike? Simple. They're all deadly.
reward_tree_draconic_border_story_pt2;Perhaps it is because of their deadliness that witchers do not accept contracts on dragons. They point to their mysterious witchers' code as the reason, yet it is rather apparent that even the famed monster slayers fear these particular draconids.
reward_tree_draconic_border_story_pt3;Because witchers refuse to slay dragons, the task falls to other would-be heroes. Sometimes, a knight-errant may vow to duel the winged beast. Other times, local peasants may seek to protect their village the best way they know how... By stuffing a sheep's carcass with poison.
reward_tree_draconic_border_story_pt4;Regardless of the method, however, most attempts at dragonslaying usually end poorly for the would-be slayers. Yet, if that's true, where are all the dragons? Well, according to legend, they have flown across the Great Sea, to lands as yet untainted by humankind.
reward_tree_draconic_border_title;Season of the Draconid
reward_tree_draconid_2_story_chest;After a great and successfully unsuccessful hunt, Myrgtabrakke gave her barely hatched daughter to Villentretenmerth, in return for the rescue and for her own safety⁠—a “Dragon of Surprise”, one could say. Later, Myrg went into hiding far away from human settlements, and away from any other dragon. Away from everything. She had always been a loner, and her clash with the hunting party of King Niedamir⁠—especially with Barefield’s loud rabble⁠—only confirmed that she preferred solitude to the company of others.\nNonetheless, Myrgtabrakke kept a watchful eye on her daughter.\nShe usually did this out of sight, because Saesenthessis, known as Saskia by common folk, for some incomprehensible reason, was interested in both human and non-human matters. Myrgtabrakke, although she was unable to quite understand, never interfered in her daughter’s curious affairs, nor ever tried to stop her.\nBut she watched. Always. Ensuring that Saesenthessis was never, ever truly alone.
reward_tree_draconid_2_story_pt1;Myrgtabrakke belonged to the most common variety of dragons. The green ones. Unfortunately, due to the similar coloration of the scales, they are notoriously mistaken for slyzards. Despite the species’ name, they often appear to be greenish gray, or grayish green, similar to that of the lesser draconids. As a result, these intelligent reptiles are more actively hunted than any other type of dragon.
reward_tree_draconid_2_story_pt2;One of the most famous hunts in the history of the North concerned Myrgtabrakke herself, with the event owing its fame to the legendary hunting party. Led by Niedamir, King of Caingorn, its participants⁠—not counting almost half of Barefield’s residents⁠—comprised Yarpen Zigrin and his company of dwarves, Boholt and his Crinfrid Reavers, Eyck of Denesle, mages Dorregaray of Vole and Yennefer of Vengerberg, witcher Geralt of Rivia with his friend Dandelion, and finally, the knight Borch Three Jackdaws, known also by another name … A dragon's name.
reward_tree_draconid_2_story_pt3;So while most of the party pursued the wounded Myrgtabrakke for various compensations, the witcher and the knight took part in the hunt for quite different reasons. Geralt, unable to escape the bond between him and the sorceress, found himself once again⁠—and not for the last time⁠⁠—following Yennefer. Meanwhile, Villentretenmerth, using the name Borch Three Jackdaws among humans, joined the famous ensemble for one reason, and one reason alone: to save Myrgtabrakke.
reward_tree_draconid_2_story_pt4;When the hunters finally reached the cave where Myrgtabrakke was hiding, it came to light why the dragon didn’t just scurry away, easily escaping her imminent slaughter. She would not abandon her egg and leave the precious life within at the mercy of the self-proclaimed monster slayers⁠—brazen hunters who cared not if the creature was actually intelligent. Fortunately, witchers still had their “code”, and Geralt of Rivia helped Villentretenmerth save the green dragon and her offspring. As for the other party members ... Well, instead of treasure and prestige, they only found their bloodlust repaid in kind.

reward_tree_dryad_2_story_chest;Long ago, Aglaïs promised herself something in secret.\nAs fate would have it, thanks to her notable skills, she was able to keep that promise. From an early age, when she was just a grub crawling among the trees, she showed an innate talent for healing, even among hamadryads. This was why Lady Eithné never compelled her to take up arms; never forced Aglaïs to break her vow of pacifism—not even during times of war. The healer loathed the thought of killing. She accepted death as the natural end of all living things, but rejected the possibility that she could ever inflict it upon others.\nAnd so she never did.
reward_tree_dryad_2_story_pt1;Aglaïs was the chief healer in Col Serrai, the famous hot spring basin, when Geralt of Rivia arrived there—battered and broken. The witcher had been badly wounded during his duel with sorcerer Vilgefortz on Thanedd Island, and was in grave need of help. If it were not for the restorative hand of the hamadryad, he would never have fought again.
reward_tree_dryad_2_story_pt2;The superior healer of Col Serrai was well known for her taciturnity. The reason for this was quite simple: Aglaïs had never seen anybody heal faster due to idle chatter. So she chose her words carefully and talked only when the situation required it. When she didn't have to waste her breath—she didn't.
reward_tree_dryad_2_story_pt3;In addition to the forces of nature, the chief healer used forest water and curative rhizomes—most prominently, the famous combination of conynhael and knitbone. But the key to healing the most grievous of wounds lay with the extraordinary skill of the hamadryad herself.
reward_tree_dryad_2_story_pt4;Amazingly, contrary to popular belief about dryads and their kin, Aglaïs saw no difference between treating humans and non-humans alike. If someone was sick or injured, regardless of who or what they were, she would do whatever she could to make them whole again.

reward_tree_dryad_avatar_chest_1;Triss Merigold is sometimes called the Fourteenth of the Hill. The moniker refers to the Battle of Sodden at which many mages and sorceresses perished while fighting for the North. Struck to the ground with a powerful spell, it seemed Triss had shared the others' fate. Fortunately, it turned out news of her death was somewhat exaggerated...
reward_tree_dryad_avatar_chest_2;When King Radovid V began his hunt for mages, Triss – like many of her colleagues – sought refuge in Novigrad, a neutral city. In place of a haven, however, she and the others found themselves in a trap. Soon the bodies of mages and sorceresses began to pile up, their lives extinguished by the fanatical priests from the Church of the Eternal Fire. Those lucky enough to be spared a gruesome death owe their thanks to Triss... As well as a certain white-haired witcher.
reward_tree_dryad_avatar_chest_3;Triss had countless admirers, but only ever truly loved one – Geralt of Rivia, the White Wolf. The two have endured countless trials together. Salamandra's siege on Kaer Morhen, the putsch at Loc Muinne, the exodus of mages from Novigrad, the battle against the Wild Hunt... Yet, it wasn't all blood and tragedy. That being said, no chronicler of strong repute would dare detail their more... intimate... moments.
reward_tree_dryad_avatar_story_pt1;Contrary to common belief, dryads on rare occasion would permit humans into their forest. Among that privileged minority was Milva Barring, well-known human archer and guide. She was often contracted by enemies of Brokilon – unaware of her allegiances – to lead expeditions against the dryads... Every time leading her patrons into an ambush...

reward_tree_dryad_border_chest_2;Contrary to common belief, dryads on rare occasion would permit humans into their forest.

But under Eithné's care, the White Wolf recovered and soon returned to the Path.
reward_tree_dryad_border_story_pt1;It is common knowledge that among dryads – known also as eerie wives – you will find only women. They require human men for reproduction, which begs the question... What are they really? What is their origin?
reward_tree_dryad_border_story_pt2;Many scholars contend that dryads do not comprise a unique race, like gnomes or vrans, but humans fundamentally altered by magic. If true, dryads would be considered cursed beings, not unlike werewolves...
reward_tree_dryad_border_story_pt3;Indeed, one legend tells that the first dryads were ordinary human women, enchanted by elves to support the Aen Seide in battle. Rather than fulfill their intended purpose, however, they took to the forest and have remained there ever since.
reward_tree_dryad_border_story_pt4;And what of the eerie wives themselves? Have they knowledge of their origin? One ambitious student from Oxenfurt ventured to Brokilon to find out. Unsurprisingly, he was never heard from again... Yet a dozen-odd years later, scholars from his department spotted several young dryads who bore a striking resemblance to their lost colleague...

reward_tree_eist_chest_1;Eist Tuirseach and Calanthe never bore children. Some claimed that the Lioness of Cintra – for whom this was her second marriage – was incapable of granting an heir due to her advanced age. However, those closest to Eist knew better. The islander never wished to father a child – not after witnessing what power resided within Calanthe's daughter, Pavetta. In the veins of Cintrian royalty flowed the Elder Blood, which he believed would not mix well with the hot temper so characteristic of Skelligers.
reward_tree_eist_chest_2;Eist became renowned on the Isles for his skills as a sailor. He could maneuver a longship through Skellige's narrowest fjords on a moonless night, navigate the fiercest storms at full sail, and drive Nilfgaardian ships more than twice the size of his own onto the islands' jagged, rocky coastlines. Who knows what new and exotic lands he might have discovered had he not planted his roots in Cintra...
reward_tree_eist_chest_3;To ensure his ship never deviated from its course, Eist often closely observed the stars. Yet one night – lying on the deck of his longship, hands clasped behind his head – he eyed something more than just a map etched in sky. He saw something that turned the good-humored, carefree adventurer in him into a grim and somber man. Whenever asked what he saw in the stars that night, Eist merely replied... "The future."
reward_tree_eist_story_pt1;Eist looked different than the other islanders. His hair dark, his skin markedly aged and weathered by the sun – he stood out in a crowd. His appearance, it seemed, paralled a certain longing, for he often looked upon the horizon, his gaze distant, giving the sense that his thoughts were lost somewhere far beyond Skellige's shores...
reward_tree_eist_story_pt2;Eventually, Eist did leave his homeland to settle in Cintra at the side of the illustrious Queen Calanthe. They say one look from the swarthy pirate was enough to melt the queen's icy heart...
reward_tree_eist_story_pt3;Although Eist loved Calanthe beyond measure, he was never truly happy in Cintra. He could not shake the lingering feeling that catastrophe awaited him, that a tragic fate had been written for him in the stars...
reward_tree_eist_story_pt4;Indeed, several years following their wedding, Nilfgaard attacked Cintra. Eist fought the invaders with the fury of a sea devil, but eventually fell, pierced by an arrow. The Skellige Isles, his homeland, now serve as his final resting place. He lies there alone, for Calanthe's body was never found.

reward_tree_eithne_chest_1;Dryads possess a power allowing them to influence plants to grow in any shape. In this way they construct their fortifications, homes, and palaces. The process is slow, sometimes lasting centuries... Fortunately, dryads are a patient bunch.
reward_tree_eithne_chest_2;The most gifted dryads are able to push this ability further, to create new life-forms from plants, capable of movement... Even rudimentary thought. These beings are known as treants. Few have laid eyes upon them – knowingly, at least. In a dense forest, they are near impossible to spot... And even more difficult to escape.
reward_tree_eithne_chest_3;From time to time, the human leaders of the realms that border Brokilon – Verden, Cidaris, and Temeria – once again resolve to set ablaze the primeval forest and the dryads who dwell within. Up to the wood's edge they transport barrels of tar and straw. However, they are typically abandoned with haste after the first volley of silent arrows is released from behind the wall of trees.
reward_tree_eithne_story_pt1;Even sworn enemies sometimes negotiate, perhaps in the hope of establishing a compromise or truce. But never Eithné, Queen of the Dryads. Her hatred toward humans is unwavering. To their bargains, pleas, cries, threats, her answer is always the same – a well-aimed arrow between the eyes.
reward_tree_eithne_story_pt2;Under Eithné's leadership, humans are never permitted to enter the forests of Brokilon. Well... Almost never. After all, even dryads must procreate somehow.
reward_tree_eithne_story_pt3;For this reason, dryads will kidnap human girls and, occasionally, men in their prime. Their role in dryad society is easy to guess. However, they are then forever banished from the forest once their "duty" is fulfilled... Despite their impassioned pleas to stay.

reward_tree_eldain_chest_1;It's commonly known that Eldain had a soft spot for music. In fact, prior to joining the Scoia'tael, he frequented human festivals as a lutist. On one occasion, Eldain's forces captured a minstrel who requested to sing rather than utter his final words, in the hopes that Eldain would be swayed to mercy. Indeed, with a grin across his face, Eldain enjoyed and applauded the bard's performance. He then ordered the man flayed alive.
reward_tree_eldain_chest_2;Eldain selected the Moulderwood as the base of his commando's operation, for it was a primordial forest so dense that even under the glare of the noon sun it bore the semblance of twilight. Only two types of human caravans ever traversed it: those surrounded by at least twenty armed guards, and those that never emerged.
reward_tree_eldain_chest_3;When Eldain's commando seized control of the Moulderwood, many Aen Seidhe insisted he rebuild the numerous elven ruins scattered throughout, yet Eldain always refused. Some suspected the ruins benefitted the Scoia'tael by reminding the elves of human cruelty. The truth was much more mundane. Columns serve as better cover when toppled.
reward_tree_eldain_story_pt1;Eldain tried, with all the strength his will could muster, to live in peace among humans. He bowed to his neighbors in respect, brushed off insults and the occasional shove. Yet when the surrounding orchards suffered from blight, a scapegoat was needed. Someone, anyone to blame for their misfortune. Eldain was an elf – and that was enough.
reward_tree_eldain_story_pt2;Eldain joined the Scoia'tael fully aware that their war was doomed to fail, and at the end of that road only death awaited him. He decided, therefore, that his mission in life would be to live on in memories of humans – as a nightmare.
reward_tree_eldain_story_pt3;Eldain knows how to stir and play on people's fears. He tortures his victims in roadside thickets, where their screams are within earshot of every passing traveler. The mutilated corpses he then leaves exposed to rot near human settlements.
reward_tree_eldain_story_pt4;It comes as no surprise that quickly Eldain became the most hated of all Scoia'tael in Aedirn. Yet despite the immense bounty placed on his head by the king, few dared seek him out...

reward_tree_elf_2_story_chest;There was something Ida Emean didn't mention to anyone, not even to Francesca.\nThe elven sage secretly loved the sea.\nShe wasn't ashamed of this feeling, since it would be hard to find something more pure and innocent. She simply liked to keep all sentiments to herself, instead of sharing them with others. Therefore, she watched the sea alone and listened to it carefully, while the waves swept her feet. Open waters somehow reminded her of a long lost home, despite living in the Blue Mountains. Nonetheless, she never said it out loud. Only her appearance could reveal those feelings she kept hidden at the bottom of her heart. She never wore precious metals or mountain stones, always preferring pearls, coral, and amber over them.\nThere was something soothing in those little pieces of jewelry. A small reminder of a home Ida never really had.
reward_tree_elf_2_story_pt1;Red-haired and large-eyed Ida Emean aep Sivney was the second elf – next to Francesca Findabair – in the Lodge of Sorceress, and the only Aen Saevherne there. Though it was not very surprising, since sages are a very rare sight even among the elves and meeting them is considered a great honor.
reward_tree_elf_2_story_pt2;But that’s also why Ida provoked suspicions among other members of the Lodge – by her very presence. The free elves from the Blue Mountains usually avoided not only humans but even their own kind, especially those who lived in close proximity to humans. Regardless, she decided to join their order.
reward_tree_elf_2_story_pt3;Of course, she wasn’t following her heart or acting on impulse. It was pure politics. Since the queen of Dol Blathanna wished her to join the Lodge, Ida did. Otherwise, she would not be meddling in human affairs. After all, history often proved that it brings only trouble.
reward_tree_elf_2_story_pt4;So, after the fall of the Lodge, when Triss Merigold asked her for help in the fight against Wild Hunt, Ida outright refused. No hesitation, no reproach. She could ally with people if the need arose, but she was not going to die for them.\nNot even in a thousand years.

reward_tree_elf_avatar_chest_1;Although more than two hundred years have passed since Aelirenn's rebellion, her memory yet lives on. At the palace of Shaerrawedd, situated in the wilds of Kaedwen, Scoia'tael warriors continue to tend to Aelirenn's beloved garden – her treasured white roses in particular. On occasion, human travelers have inadvertently stumbled upon the hallowed grounds. Enchanted by the beauty of this ivy-strewn relic of the past, some took a rose for posterity – woefully unaware of the flower's cherished significance...
reward_tree_elf_avatar_chest_2;Due to her petite and frail frame, Aelirenn never gained the reputation of legendary warrior. Rather, she is remembered for her ability to orate, to inspire in the face of common sense and better judgment. When she called for war, resistance from the elders proved futile to stop her. The last elven king and his advisers knew full well that defeat on the battlefield would herald the eventual destruction of their race. With tears in their eyes, they watched on from palace windows as the elven kingdom's last line of defense marched off to war in the face of impossible odds.
reward_tree_elf_avatar_chest_3;Aelirenn's banner did not bear a coat of arms nor seal of the elven kingdom. She used but a simple circle, for this represented the globe and thus the scope of her ambitions. The other Elder Races – dwarves, halflings, and gnomes – looked upon the standard with a feeling of unease. They knew not the fate that would await them should the White Rose of Shaerawedd achieve victory... Humans, on the other hand, merely laughed at the sight of the Aelirenn's standard. Why? Because any fool with half a brain knows the world is flat...
reward_tree_elf_avatar_story_pt1;Today, It is commonly believed that the elven kingdom's demise was inevitable. Yet, who can know truly? If not for Aelirenn's intervention, history may have followed an altogether different path.
reward_tree_elf_avatar_story_pt2;Humans and elves had agreed to a peace agreement approximately two hundred years ago. As result of the accord, the kingdom of elves – which had once stretched from the Great Sea to the Blue Mountains – was reduced to a mere scrap of land. Nevertheless... It persisted.
reward_tree_elf_avatar_story_pt3;Then emerged Aelirenn. "No more truces, no more elves on bent knee," she would profess. "This is elven land. We will take back what was stolen! We shall drive the ape-men into the sea!"
reward_tree_elf_avatar_story_pt4;The elders had warned that Aelirenn's plan would likely spell suicide. Despite their protestations, the realm's young and spirited refused to heed the elders' advice, choosing instead to follow Aelirenn's fiery rhetoric. As promised, her warriors would indeed find honor. Honor... And death.

reward_tree_elf_border_chest_1;Elves have a unique aptitude for magic. In fact, it was the Aen Seidhe who created the first spells and helped humans to master them – a gesture of goodwill in the hopes of peaceful coexistence. The elven mages of greatest renown are known as the Aen Saevherne – known more simply as "sages." The world withholds few secrets from these elves, for in addition to magic, they are adept in the fields of alchemy, astronomy, and astrology... Why, even genetics.
reward_tree_elf_border_chest_2;Many Nordlings believe that the roots of the Nilfgaardian people extend far back to an elven tribe sometimes referred to as the Black Seidhe. This would explain much. After all, their language is derived from Elder Speech, the Empire is far more developed than the North, and they treat non-humans with much less hostility... However, the truth behind such characteristics is rather different. Whereas the people of the south simply chose to adopt some of the elves' best traits,  the people of the north opted for slaughter.
reward_tree_elf_border_chest_3;Though elves are quick to paint themselves as victims of human expansion, their own consciences are far from clear. The foothills of the Blue Mountains and the shore of Loc Muinne are strewn with the ruins of ancient Vran cities. Underneath them lie caverns still littered with the bones of this intelligent reptilian race who had dwelled there well before the Aen Seidhe's arrival. Close inspection of their remains suggests that the Vrans were not wiped out by natural causes.
reward_tree_elf_border_story_pt1;The Aen Seidhe, the People of the Hills. Traces of their magnificence remain visible to this day. Palace ruins still hidden in dense forests, mysterious towers standing atop mountain peaks, sculptures carved from marble white as fresh snow. But the elves themselves? Their numbers continue to dwindle.
reward_tree_elf_border_story_pt2;Their decline rests in the fact that, although the Aen Seidhe surpass humans in longevity, magical aptitude, and knowledge of the natural world, they are at a disadvantage in one important regard – fertility.
reward_tree_elf_border_story_pt3;Although elves can live for centuries, they can only conceive children during their youngest years. Even then, only one out of every two or three couples will successfully bear a child. Humans, on the other hand – well... They seem to have mastered the process.
reward_tree_elf_border_story_pt4;Consequently, though the elves had at first defeated the humans time and time again, they quickly realized that ultimate victory would prove impossible. For whenever they killed one man, another five stood ready to take his place.

reward_tree_emhyr_chest_1;Emhyr var Emreis was prepared to do anything for the sake of power. Spark a war. Kill his own wife. Hurt his own daughter. All without raising his voice, without shedding a tear. His cold eyes never betrayed a glimmer of emotion. They say even the golems who serve in the Imperial Army have more heart than he...
reward_tree_emhyr_chest_2;According to royal biographers, Emhyr had, in fact, grown up a bright and cheerful lad, the apple of his father's eye. But then a coup gripped the Imperial court. The conspirators attempted to coerce Fergus var Emreis to cooperate by torturing his son in front of his very eyes. Unsuccessful, the Usurper enlisted the help of a mage, Braathens, who would transform Emhyr into a freakish, hedgehog-like man-beast. Steadfast and unflinching in the face of his son's hideous curse, the plotters had no recourse but to assassinate Fergus.
reward_tree_emhyr_chest_3;For many years Emhyr plotted his revenge. At first overwhelmed with pain and fury, he howled his throat raw, ripped hair from head, clawed at his own flesh until caked in blood. But in time  his temper cooled and he began to analyze, to calculate. Upon regaining the Imperial throne, Emhyr coldly condemned his father's conspirators to death. He watched their executions in full, then stood without a word and returned to work.
reward_tree_emhyr_story_pt1;Emhyr var Emreis, the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of his Foes. No other name arouses such fear in the hearts of Nordlings. It was during his reign Nilfgaardian forces crossed the Yaruga into the North for the first time... And the second... Oh, and the third...
reward_tree_emhyr_story_pt2;What motivated Emhyr var Emreis? Historians have long debated it. Some have argued he bent to the will of merchants and traders. Others – that he sought new, fertile lands for Nilfgaardian settlement. But what was the truth?

From the hidden sanctum of Duén Canell, she watched and protected that which was most important: the forest and all who lived there. Without any compromise, it would seem. But in the days long forgotten, Eithné would parley with human envoys, listen to what the distant kings had to say, and if need be, settle with them to ensure peace was retained.
reward_tree_ep5_eithne_story_pt_2;Over time, humans grew bolder, and their demand for timber and lust for long-lost treasure brought them deeper into Brokilon⁠—into direct conflict with the dryads. This led to a war between the two races; a war that would see Eithné's daughter, Morénn, slaughtered and mutilated by Kerackian soldiers during the Battle of the Ribbon. Since then, any chance of compromise vanished, and Eithné ensured all human intruders would henceforth be met with an arrow to the head.

reward_tree_ep5_eredin_story_pt1;Before Eredin chased Cirilla to her dimension, he served King Auberon Muircetach as a cavalry commander in Tir ná Lia. For his ruler, with the Red Riders at his side, he regularly hunted the race that originally inhabited the world of Aen Elle. The unicorns. It’s them, who gave the elf his nickname – Sparrowhawk, for he was their hated enemy and an excellent hunter. Both his looks and behavior resembled a dark bird of prey.\nMoreover, when Ciri arrived in the world of Aen Elle, it became clear that Eredin had what Auberon Muircetach had long lacked – strength and determination to act. Thus, it didn’t take long before he decided to poison the old king for the good of his own people.
reward_tree_ep5_eredin_story_pt2;In the distant past, when the Winter Queen was still alive and King Auberon Muircetach had just formed the Red Riders, Eredin had power over Ard Gaeth, the Gates of the Worlds. Thanks to this, he could travel freely to other dimensions, and whenever he did so, he invaded the chosen world ruthlessly. During these raids, his main goal was to find and secure a sufficient number of slaves, preferably humans, who could serve Aen Elle in their world or provide them as a source of power.\nOver time, these events have become a grave legend.

Not one to back down from a fight, regardless of his chances, he would often find himself in unwinnable scraps. Clansmen jested that Harald knew not the difference between bravery and stupidity, and this sentiment was proven true time and again. No more so than when he single-handedly took on a fully-grown bear. Miraculously, Harald survived the bout, but the grizzly behemoth left his leg permanently mangled.

Oh, especially their Law of Surprise: "You will give me what you already have but which you do not know about yet." And they dare to describe his offers as unclear or not fair? Hilarious, really!\nAfter all, he only opens the eyes of those who wanted to look for themselves. He reveals the madness of the world around them and shows the opportunities that come with it. He navigates the paths that may happen. However, it is up to humans to choose which path they will follow. Will this beautiful woman break the word given by her late husband, or will she keep his oath? Will the warrior lie, cheat, and kill his brothers? Will the old hero save one life, letting thousands die in return? And will the young fool kill thousands to presumably save the world?\nIt’s entirely their choice.\n\nHuman traditions are almost as entertaining to O'Dimm as playing with destiny. Sometimes he even checks himself if they still follow the ancient customs. He wanders around this world, watching as peasants burn their logs for the dead or women tie red ribbons at the cradles to scare off wraiths. As a begging old man, he asks for food, and when the night of Saovine arrives, he waits for people to hide in their cottages from those that have departed this world. Seldomly, those who do not manage to hide or are too drunk for it, get the chance to meet him instead of the dreaded dead. And if they fail to comply with any of his humble requests, showing their disrespect for these ancient traditions, they will see his true face.\n\nBoth monsters and non-humans appear to be resistant to Master Mirror’s influence, or at least they succumb to him less often than humans. It is difficult to say where this comes from, as they can be as greedy, envious, and stupid as any man. Does O’Dimm really have no effect on their souls? Well, it’s possible. However, it sounds too simple to be the whole truth. Looking closely, one could tell that O’Dimm interferes in the affairs of monsters or non-humans, just not directly. For instance, it is enough to subtly aid the right prince in winning the throne, to stoke the flames of hatred, and subsequently turn the lives of thousands of dryads into hell. \nIsn’t it?
reward_tree_ep5_main_story_pt1;For many people, Gaunter O'Dimm is a mystery. Actually for anyone who has had the misfortune to meet him. As a rule Master Mirror doesn’t explain his provenance to anyone unless he wants his interlocutor to live a short and painful life.
reward_tree_ep5_main_story_pt2;For those few who managed to get to know the real name of Master Mirror have long since died – or had something far worse befell them. A simple exploration of his past leads those curious to blindness, with even a short meeting in a crowd changing the fate of man forever.
reward_tree_ep5_main_story_pt3;According to books that can be found in Oxenfurt libraries, Master Mirror is the embodiment of pure Evil, appearing for thousands of years in different cultures, under many different names. Gaunter himself considers this to be a not quite accurate and highly ignorant description of him. He only gives people what they want – he is not to blame for the fact that they want evil and wicked things.
reward_tree_ep5_main_story_pt4;However, one cannot deny at least this: Gaunter O'Dimm is an ages-old creature. He can be found on the edges of the history pages throughout many pivotal events for the Continent. On the other hand, it is difficult to describe his actions as purely evil. Gaunter just reveals secrets selectively, not lying even a bit. He gave a kid a toy to shape his dreams or simply helped a lost man find his way. And he stayed there, hidden in the shadows, to watch what would happen next. Just for his pure amusement.\nYet people often blame him for… For everything, really.\nIt’s simply wondrous, how they’re desperate to believe that gods and other supreme beings control their lives.

reward_tree_ep6_main_story_pt2;Knight or outcast? Charlatan or genius? Brute or hero? Well, it's quite difficult to point out just one answer, especially when it comes to mages who outlive the natural order.
reward_tree_ep6_main_story_pt3;The truth, as it often happens, can be found somewhere in the middle. Alzur was an ambiguous figure. In fact, neither malicious nor benevolent. For he performed both great and vile deeds. Idealistic as well as petty.
reward_tree_ep6_main_story_pt4;Perhaps Alzur's conflicting nature was due to the fact that his actions were largely dictated by… memory. The memory of someone who was completely different from him. A woman who believed in goodness and sacrifice—and ultimately gave her life for it.

reward_tree_ep6_milfgaard_story_chest;The Witcher School of the Viper made their home in the stronghold of Gorthur Gvaed. Guarded by a remarkable tower adorned by a frighteningly ominous spiral coiled around its contours. Yet it held not a candle to the terrifying moat that surrounded it—deep by several hundred feet and truly… breathtaking. No one could tell if what was filling it should still be called water. The smells above the moat were, to put it mildly, hard to forget. Viper witchers, who survived the fall of the stronghold, later joked that it was the stench that led the Usurper’s army to find Gorthur Gvaed.\nCountless soldiers died in this gutter. According to legends, so many perished that one could have made their way to the other side of the moat on a bridge composed entirely of their corpses. And the odour grew even worse.
reward_tree_ep6_milfgaard_story_pt1;Ivar founded the Viper School having a great purpose in mind—contrary to rumours that its sole reason for existence was to offer less savoury services. The grandmaster understood that he would not be able to achieve his true goal alone—he intended to find and defeat the Wild Hunt.
reward_tree_ep6_milfgaard_story_pt2;You see, Ivar was one of the unfortunate few who endured the mutations extremely well, and so was selected for further, more complicated experiments. Of those subjected to these enhancements, only he survived—perhaps due to the mages only managing to partially complete the trial.
reward_tree_ep6_milfgaard_story_pt3;As a result of these experiments, Ivar gained his moniker, as well as a new sight. His so-called “Evil Eye” saw a different world. Many other worlds, really. With his eye, he watched as ghostly riders dashed along the Spiral, and observed how they’d kidnap, kill, and conquer. Forever haunting Ivar’s special vision, these spectres became his obsession.
reward_tree_ep6_milfgaard_story_pt4;Unfortunately, while he managed to get to know his enemy extremely well, he never got close enough to do much about it. Though he could glimpse their rampage from afar, he shared not their mobility, and found himself endlessly chasing shadows.\nWhen the Wild Hunt was finally defeated, Ivar was long dead.

reward_tree_ep6_monsters_story_chest;Dol Dhu Lokke was once a beautiful, lively valley with a slightly different, more ear-friendly name. Everything changed with the Conjunction of Spheres. The earth broke and terrifying creatures appeared upon the surface, bringing death to everything beautiful in the valley.\nFor the following years, no one dared to go to Dol Dhu Lokke—except for witchers. These were of two kinds. Those who thought they would become famous by finally purging the place of monsters. And those looking for a glorious death. Only the latter achieved their aim.\nIn the end, what the witchers failed to do, was accomplished by hunger. Because predators outnumbered their prey, they lacked food. Therefore, the monsters began to fight among themselves.\nUntil they all killed each other… or starved.
reward_tree_ep6_monsters_story_pt1;The viy was a monster born due to a combination of magic and bad luck. It was created in Maribor by Alzur himself with his infamous Double-Cross. But the spell was not a success. A creature with a serpentine body and a million legs sprang up over the city, then went berserk and began to destroy everything in sight.
reward_tree_ep6_monsters_story_pt2;By the time the viy left Maribor, it had turned about half of the buildings there into ruin. Soon after, the monster—bloated with human flesh—hid in the forests of Riverdell and fell into a deep slumber. It is possible that it would never have woken up if it were not for the actions of the Council of Mages.
reward_tree_ep6_monsters_story_pt3;Sorcerers wanted to study the last known creation of Alzur. Nonetheless, the sight of the monster left them speechless with terror. Mages were aware of the destruction it caused in Maribor, yet they had not expected a creature of such enormous size. Neither did they dream of waking it up. The spells they used were intended to bind the viy. Once again, however, the viy proved to be quite resistant to magic.
reward_tree_ep6_monsters_story_pt4;After the last envoy of the Council had said goodbye to his life, the viy allegedly disappeared without a trace. But some say they saw a huge shadow crawl out of the forests of the Left Bank and head south.\nTowards Dol Dhu Lokke, to be precise.

reward_tree_ep6_nrealms_story_chest;The Witcher School of the Griffin made their home within the walls of the Caer y Seren fortress, or Kaer Seren if you go by the common tongue. This was a prominent fortification due to its location. Not because it stood on the shores of the Great Sea, but because of its vicinity to the Dragon Mountains. As a result, reaching Kaer Seren by land proved too daunting a task for most. The locale also provided the residents of Kaer Seren access to seafaring traders, ensuring they were always well-supplied. Armed with crossbows, a secured position, and a reliable source of provisions, the Griffins remained ready and capable to repel any assault.\nNevertheless, not a single soldier was employed in Kaer Seren’s destruction.\nUsing the very mountains that had long protected the Griffins, the Council of Mages turned the tables—unleashing a devastating avalanche… burying them alive. Only Keldar survived.\nThe old mentor still guards the ruined fortress of his beloved school.
reward_tree_ep6_nrealms_story_pt1;Erland of Larvik was one of the first witchers created by Alzur, and would go on to become the perfect embodiment of the mage's vision, despite holding great contempt for the man and his so-called "Trials".
reward_tree_ep6_nrealms_story_pt2;Nevertheless, the master of the Griffin School sincerely believed in the same values ​​that Alzur professed. Like the mage, he knew "The Guide to Chivalric Virtues" by heart, and could recite any passage from the book at a moment's notice. Erland even learned fencing from one of the great-grandchildren of its author. In a sense, he became a knight before he became a witcher.
reward_tree_ep6_nrealms_story_pt3;This was one of the reasons why Erland founded his own school—to guide witchers toward more noble virtues, in hopes of changing how the common folk perceived them. Perhaps one day, he envisioned, they would stop fearing the monster slayers and instead show respect and gratitude.
reward_tree_ep6_nrealms_story_pt4;Erland of Larvik also conceived a future where Griffins would not have to charge anybody for their services. To this end, once he made his name famous, the witcher began to visit royal courts in an attempt to persuade rulers to donate to his cause. If successful, even a beggar without a broken oren to his name could count on the help of a Griffin.\nUnfortunately, while the aristocrats respected Erland, they failed to see any way they could profit from such an investment, and so denied the witcher’s request each and every time.

reward_tree_ep6_scoiatael_story_chest;The Witcher School of the Cat did not have one specific home. Over the years, there were numerous hiding places in which witchers subjected their adepts to mutations. They created numerous camps where they trained together. Nevertheless, the founder of the Cats was indeed “created” in Stygga Castle, and thus—it was their first home.\nNot for long, however.\nIn rebellion against those who created them, young Gezras led other witchers to escape the castle. Needless to say, they had to earn their freedom by force. After the painful experiments they were subjected to, many were more than eager to bleed the mages that had wronged them.\nLater, the Cats grew stronger, bolstering their ranks with badly mutated witchers who had been rejected by other schools. The outcasts gathered together to raise the next generations through corrupt experimental methods. Over time, their warped mutations and aggressive disposition earned them the disdain of other schools.
reward_tree_ep6_scoiatael_story_pt1;Gezras, born a half-elf, was considered an abomination and sold to the mages of Stygga castle at a very young age. His mutations were part of a new process designed to dull the emotions of would-be witchers even more than usual. The new recipe, however, failed... spectacularly so. Instead of inhibiting emotions, the method⁠—quite ironically⁠—enhanced them, leaving Gezras and his new brothers permanently unhinged and prone to erratic behaviour.
reward_tree_ep6_scoiatael_story_pt2;More concerned with discovering the source of their error than the well-being of their test subjects, the mages caged their spoiled batch with the determination to dissect until a solution could be derived. Upon waking in a pile of discarded corpses, barely alive, Gezras was able to crawl out and free his remaining imprisoned brothers. Together, they somehow managed to escape into the night before the mages' labour could resume.
reward_tree_ep6_scoiatael_story_pt3;Over the next few years, they found refuge among the Aen Seidhe, who helped them hide from those still seeking to abolish their past mistakes. In exchange for their sanctuary, they used their skills to engage in guerilla warfare and assassinations on behalf of the elves.
reward_tree_ep6_scoiatael_story_pt4;Having grown in numbers and strength, the Feline witchers set forth to infiltrate the quarters of their misguided creators, slaughtering them as they slumbered. Their vengeance finally sated, Gezras led his newly-formed School of the Cat north where, free from their mired past, they could start anew.

reward_tree_ep6_skellige_story_chest;The Witcher School of the Bear made their home within the frigid halls of Haern Caduch—a remote fortress nestled within the peaks of the Amell mountains. Survival within its unwelcoming walls proved a constant challenge, particularly for the younger adepts. If one wasn’t huddled by the warmth of the hearth to stave off frostbite or scrambling under pelts to stave off hypothermia, there was always the never-ending removal of snow from the courtyard… It is no wonder Bear Witchers have shown extraordinary endurance—even when compared to their peers. \nEventually, many believe due to their glacial dispositions, surrounding villages banded together, agreed they would rather share the mountain with the monsters than the witchers, and marched on the keep. Having little to no bonds of brotherhood amongst themselves, they decided to part ways with both Haern Caduch and each other rather than partake in a meaningless slaughter.\nThe stronghold itself remains relatively intact to this day, albeit hidden under an ever increasingly thick layer of snow.
reward_tree_ep6_skellige_story_pt1;Arnaghad, some would say, was born stubborn. Insolent toward those in authority, he loathed anyone who tried to impose their will upon him, favouring autonomy above all else. This, in large, was the bedrock of why he went on to form his very own witcher school.
reward_tree_ep6_skellige_story_pt2;While other witchers saw in themselves a duty—a purpose that transcended mere necessity⁠—Arnaghad perceived their work as nothing more than that: work. A witcher was to take contracts, kill monsters, and collect coin⁠—anything else, he would argue, was just inflated nonsense to feed the ego.
reward_tree_ep6_skellige_story_pt3;Not wanting to be a slave to a code he did not believe in, he gathered a handful of likeminded witchers and ventured to the Amell mountains, settling into a fortress amid the icy slopes and established the Bear School; a place where would-be witchers could be taught the practicalities of their trade, without the distraction of "honourable virtues" impeding their training.
reward_tree_ep6_skellige_story_pt4;Ironically, it was the fundamentals of Arnaghad's school that ultimately led to its dereliction. For the Bear witchers, without sentiment or brotherly comradery to bind them, eventually went their separate ways, seeing no practical reason to stay loyal to each other or the master of their school.

reward_tree_ep6_syndicate_story_chest;The main hideout of the Salamandra was located in the sewers under Vizima city. It contained both the laboratories, where they produced fisstech and conducted their experiments, as well as sleeping quarters for all members. Thanks to this, the production of fisstech did not stop even for a moment. The alchemists worked on the drug tirelessly, day and night. The whole operation was managed by Gellert Bleinheim in cooperation with his brother Roland, who supplied the hideout with beggartick blossoms.\nAs for the experiments… The Salamandra mages worked ever-so-tirelessly—using stolen mutagens⁠—to create something far worse than narcotics.\nOf course, until a certain white-haired witcher decided to pay Salamandra a visit...
reward_tree_ep6_syndicate_story_pt1;Rayla genuinely hated elves. She killed countless and gladly boasted about it. Thus, one cannot deny poetic justice to what happened to her in the end.
reward_tree_ep6_syndicate_story_pt2;The elven arrows caught Rayla in Vizima during the fight between the nonhumans and the Order of the Flaming Rose. The mercenary died at the hands of those she hated the most. Or so it seemed.
reward_tree_ep6_syndicate_story_pt3;The Salamandra found Rayla—dying, hardly breathing at all—and subjected her to a mutation process. The mercenary survived, though what remained of her was dubious at best.
reward_tree_ep6_syndicate_story_pt4;Fallen Rayla was robbed of her free will with little of her mind left intact. Only the hatred that had consumed her for years remained—this time, however, her fury was not directed to the nonhumans, but to everyone, including her former companions.

reward_tree_ep7_ep7_main_chest_1;If absolute power corrupts absolutely, then reason can be found in the anxiety surrounding the subject of magic. For thousands of years, those craving power have used the mystical energy as a core component to their dastardly deeds. From Nilfgaard's abuse of outlawed necromancy and alchemical warfare to the twisted sacrificial rites of the Skellige Isles, Chaos has constantly been exploited without constraint. Indeed, one need only look briefly at the dark side of magic's history to understand the contempt held by many toward it.
reward_tree_ep7_ep7_main_chest_2;It was long before Radovid V's reign when the prejudice toward mages first reared its ugly head. Wanting to paint the whole practice in a negative light, a clutch of iconoclasts started to refer to magic as witchcraft, drawing particular attention to the deeds of the corrupt few. Soon, stories of wicked witches and their sinister schemes spread far and wide, vilifying all those who used sorcery⁠—both good and bad⁠—and stoking the flames of widespread persecution. From commoners to aristocrats, folk started regarding magic as a defilement of the natural order, with all those wielding it seen as conceited wretches, deviant and depraved. Soon after, the general perception of magic shifted quite violently, witch hunts became commonplace, and pyres began to burn brightly across the Continent, consuming the guilty and innocent alike.
reward_tree_ep7_ep7_main_chest_3;Over the years, the persecution of mages gave birth to many independent contractors specialized in rooting out and punishing all magic users. Radovid's army of Witch Hunters aside, none were known to have been more successful than Octavia Hale—the self-proclaimed "Witchfinder"⁠—and her steadfast sons, Fabian and Ignatius. The Hales were said to have an unparalleled knack for tracking the scent of witchcraft and tallied up an impressive number of profitable hunts during their active years. In fact, their methods became so dependable that, in taverns across the Northern Realms, it was often jested: if there's yet to be a witch burned in your town, ‘tis only because the Hales have yet to visit.
reward_tree_ep7_ep7_main_story_pt1;When the many worlds of the multiverse aligned, it is said that potent magic, quite unlike anything yet known, gushed forth into existence from various magical Planes. Merging with the energy already present, it embedded itself deep within all matter, forever altering the shape of our reality and the future of the world.
reward_tree_ep7_ep7_main_story_pt2;The Elemental Planes from which it came are said to contain strange beings formed from powerful magical energy. It is widely accepted that these domains⁠—and the beings⁠ within—are the source of all magic, with each of them possessing its own fundamental Element.
reward_tree_ep7_ep7_main_story_pt3;These Prime Elements comprise Air, Earth, Fire, and Water, with each embodying unique properties and requiring varying levels of proficiency to control. In addition to these fundamentals, there is a fifth, more complex essence known as Ether, which derives from the mysterious Astral Plane and is used in such magics as teleportation and suppression.
reward_tree_ep7_ep7_main_story_pt4;Those with an aptitude for magic can, with enough dedication, learn how to draw energy from each Plane, usually achieving efficiency in only one of the Elements. In the Continent’s history, it is said only a single mage has ever been able to master all four Primary Elements, illustrating the determination and talent required for such a feat. No one, however, has yet mastered all five.⁠
reward_tree_ep7_francesca_chest_1;Francesca abhorred her father’s reluctance to meet the dh’oine on the field of battle. She saw his isolation from external affairs as a cowardly act, and one that spat in the face of all elves wishing to live free from persecution. But despite her incessant beseeching, Simlas refused to send his subjects to their slaughter and forbid his daughter from getting involved. Alas, his words fell on deaf ears. Inspired by the infectious rhetoric of the warrior elf Aelirenn, Francesca defied her father’s orders, mustered her kin, and joined the rebellion.
reward_tree_ep7_francesca_chest_2;Simlas' forlorn prophecy came to be. The rebellion was short-lived, and in the wake of human conquest lay a generation of elves thoroughly suppressed and mercilessly slaughtered. Francesca was lucky enough to survive the doomed venture, yet her brash nature had cost her much. Most of her companions were dead, and the future potential of her race all but obliterated. In addition, her father, enraged by her betrayal, disowned her, vowing that words would never break between them again⁠—a promise he would keep until the end of his days.
reward_tree_ep7_francesca_chest_3;There was a time when Francesca’s decisions were guided by fiery impulse, governed by a desire to act swiftly in place of calculated tact. A lifetime of mistakes, however, can work wonders in cooling one’s hot-headedness, and slowly but surely, she became the dispassionate tactician her father had once wished her to be. But even he would recoil in horror to witness the pact she later made with the Nilfgaardian Emperor.
reward_tree_ep7_francesca_story_pt1;There was a time in Francesca Findabair’s life when she did not even remotely consider the advantages of diplomatic tact. She believed direct action was the best way to ensure survival, especially when regarding humans⁠—a race renowned for their lustful expanse and underhanded methods.
reward_tree_ep7_francesca_story_pt2;When speaking of these oppressive foreigners, she frequently quoted her father, the elven Sage Simlas Finn aep Dabairr, regurgitating the words she had often heard during childhood. ‘Only those lacking sense,’ her father would spit with pure contempt, ‘would trust the word of a dh’oine.’
reward_tree_ep7_francesca_story_pt3;Yet, her father had long since changed his tune regarding the humans. Or, at least, altered his pitch. For he had used a magical orb of insight to witness shimmers of the future, and saw that war with the ape-men would only lead to the annihilation of elves.
reward_tree_ep7_francesca_story_pt4;Not wanting to lead his kind to their deaths, Simlas swallowed his pride and entered a peace treaty with the humans, hoping the act would save the elves from massacre. Unfortunately, he could not halt the incoming destruction, as forces both within and without conspired against him. And one such force bore the face of his unruly daughter.

reward_tree_ep7_leticia_chest_1;Leticia Charbonneau felt the harsh sting of neglect time and again during her upbringing. Her mother could not shake the deep-seated grudge she harbored for⁠—as she would put it⁠—her "insufferable and undignified fall from grace," and would often blame her daughter for their current predicament. As fate would have it, it was not Leticia's royal blood nor her affinity for magic that paved her way to success and established the foundation for her legacy. It was, quite ironically, her mother's perpetual contempt and resentment, along with a rather wretched childhood. The whole ordeal ignited a passion deep within her soul, and when Leticia was still relatively young, she promised herself that she would never spread hatred nor hostility⁠—would never make anyone feel as worthless or as alone as she had felt. In fact, she would do damned best to incite inspiration, encouragement, and love whenever and wherever she could. And she did just that.
reward_tree_ep7_leticia_chest_2;Who knows what Leticia's life would have looked like should she not have had what many mages refer to as a "conduit event." In a fleeting moment of pure rage, she had accidentally uprooted a sizable elm tree, engulfing it in a fierce gale and launching it halfway across a pasture and into the side of a barn. Scared and confused, Leticia had not the faintest idea of what had happened, and the destruction was far from her intent. Soon after, word had gotten out about the "miraculous child," and the girl was packed off to Aretuza (an opportunity her mother was all too eager to snatch up). Later, the young girl would discover that she had displayed an innate and apparently very impressive affinity for one of the Primary Elements of magic⁠—Air.
reward_tree_ep7_leticia_chest_3;There are few alumni that would disagree with the sentiment: Leticia Charbonneau was one of the most beloved headmistresses to ever hold the position at Aretuza. Unlike the cold indifference usually favored by her predecessors, she spearheaded a more compassionate and intimate approach to teaching. Like her colleagues, she believed the women of Aretuza should indeed be the embodiment of grace, strength, intelligence, and fearlessness⁠—especially in a world still dominated by men. And such feats, of course, required hard work, dedication, and sacrifice. Yet, to achieve such lofty aspirations, Leticia opted to nurture and encourage each and every student, regardless of their perceived proficiency; or lack thereof. Through these ideals, Leticia made the often stringent school a more accommodating experience during her long tenure, and for centuries after her departure, she would still be remembered as the woman who could root out the most remarkable of talents in even the most unremarkable of students⁠—a legacy that brought her much pride.
reward_tree_ep7_leticia_story_pt1;One may assume that being born the daughter of a King would afford a child a promising start to life. But for Leticia Charbonneau, this notion was far from reality.
reward_tree_ep7_leticia_story_pt2;Gardic, the second King of Temeria, had taken many mistresses in his time. Yet, none were held in higher regard than the marquise Carezza Charbonneau⁠—his favorite and most beloved courtship. At least, until he discarded her.
reward_tree_ep7_leticia_story_pt3;Unfortunately⁠—for both parties involved⁠—the marquise fell pregnant, which was a troublesome affair for the monarch, despite his already sullied reputation. He abhorred the idea of rumors spreading throughout his court, with wagging tongues telling tales of a bastard child, and so he banished Carezza, urging her to never return to his domain.
reward_tree_ep7_leticia_story_pt4;While in exile, far from the luxuries she had once known⁠, Carezza gave birth to Leticia. Yet, the former marquise resented the child for the hardships her mere existence had brought upon them both. Although she had the decency to raise the child out of duty⁠—a trait she had always admired about her former lover⁠—Carezza would later take another leaf out of Gardic’s book, and abandoned her daughter the moment she was of age.

reward_tree_ep7_melusine_chest_1;There was once a sea witch called Fucusya who, against all reason, fell in love with a rather riotous pirate captain: Rioghan of Faroe. Not being one for the simple life, he craved action and adventure above all else, often leaving the witch for months at a time to embark on grand ventures. Despite the many blessings Fucusya bestowed upon her love to keep him safe, Rioghan's well of luck finally ran dry, and he was slain during a skirmish. Yet, the sea witch would not surrender her man to the afterlife so easily, and thus called upon powerful magic to raise the pirate from his watery grave.
reward_tree_ep7_melusine_chest_2;‘Let his life burn as bright as the love between us!’ The once-fabled words of the sea witch Fucusya marked her beloved’s miraculous return from death. They also sealed his fate. For Rioghan had never truly loved the witch, often taking many other lovers during their time together. And so, from that fateful day henceforth, he was doomed to never again feel truly alive. The boon of new life quickly mutated into a bleak existence of apathy. So, the pirate captain, desperate to recapture the thrills he had once felt, abandoned Fucusya a final time in pursuit of adventure⁠, ultimately shattering the witch’s heart. With no love left to fuel the fires of Rioghan’s life, his futile search for satisfaction would become his eternal torment.
reward_tree_ep7_melusine_chest_3;A local legend tells the tale of a cursed pirate, doomed to wander the coasts of Spikeroog for all time in a never-ending pursuit of purpose, unable to leave dry land and return to his seafaring adventures. Those that claim to have bore witness to the meandering man say he appears in a constant state of lethargy, void of any emotion and completely lacking in awareness. He merely walks. And walks. And walks. Day in, day out. No more than a corpse animated by routine motion that steadily propels him toward no place in particular. Most folk, however, dismiss the tale of such a man as utter hogwash, stating that the sightings are of nothing more than a drunk hermit going about his day... most likely.
reward_tree_ep7_melusine_story_pt1;Melusine was a powerful and particularly ferocious ekhidna who stalked the coasts of Spikeroog, devouring all those unfortunate enough to stray too close to her lair. However, in a time long past, the beast did not have to hunt for food, for it was brought to her and given freely…
reward_tree_ep7_melusine_story_pt2;Local cultists dutifully worshipped the flying terror for centuries, sating her appetite with offerings of wheat, livestock, and⁠—on special occasions⁠—human sacrifice. They believed beyond all doubt that the creature could command the sea and weather, and would wreak havoc upon their raiding fleets should they not continue to satisfy her rapacious hunger.
reward_tree_ep7_melusine_story_pt3;Once every generation, the cultists were compelled to sacrifice one of the many descendants of their clan’s founder. The Children of Faroe, they were called, and to be chosen as such was a great honor. The event was a sacred rite that the islanders dared not defy for fear of enticing the wrath of Melusine. Yet, after centuries, the reason behind such a terrible and peculiar tradition had been all but forgotten.
reward_tree_ep7_melusine_story_pt4;There are still those, however, who profess knowledge of the origin of Melusine and her devoted cultists.

reward_tree_ep7_nilfgaard_chest_pt1;Vilgefortz did not need absolute power to be corrupted absolutely. Indeed, the mere pursuit of such a thing was more than enough to warp him beyond redemption. For reasons unknown, and driven by an unwavering desire to achieve his soaring ambitions, Vilgefortz sought to elevate himself to a god-like status, and was utterly consumed by this vision. To do this, he was convinced that he needed the Elder Blood, which just so happened to flow through the veins of a certain ashen-haired Child Surprise. Unfortunately for the megalomaniacal mage, the descendant of Lara Dorren had an entourage of formidable and ruthlessly loyal allies, and Vilgefortz met his grim fate at the end of a witcher’s sword.
reward_tree_ep7_nilfgaard_chest_pt2;Vilgefortz had never truly felt empathy. To him, it was a concept as alien as the most distant stars in the night sky. He had, however, perceived it in others, and saw clearly its significance within a social context. Reflecting upon the importance of such a skill, he concluded it would be beneficial for him to harness the power of empathy, so he may use it to his advantage. Thus, he studied it, closely observing how compassion and sympathy were used to form relations, bolster friendships, and⁠—most importantly to the mage⁠⁠—how they could be used to manipulate others. He mimicked what he saw, practiced his performance, and perfected his routine. Soon enough, he could maneuver the emotions of others as fluidly as he could wield a staff or shape the element of fire. As if simply pulling at the strings of a marionette, he turned his acquaintances into obedient puppets. Tethered to their master by an unwavering loyalty⁠, many of his underlings were compelled to commit atrocious acts on Vilgefortz’s behalf, with some even willingly sacrificing themselves to further the mage’s cause.
reward_tree_ep7_nilfgaard_chest_pt3;During his long stint as a mercenary, Vilgefortz traveled to the far corners of the world, assimilating the ways of various cultures and mastering an array of exotic weaponry⁠—including his favorite of all: the quarterstaff. A formidable fighter in his own right, the mercenary’s capabilities only flourished as he was indoctrinated in the ways of magic. Drawing upon the elemental planes, he would imbue his staff with the power of chaos. With a quick flick of the wrist, his weapon would hit with the full force of a battering ram, while remaining as light as a wisp of smoke. Moreover, he would use magic to achieve near-perfect precision and to hone his reflexes to split-second reactions. With this in mind, one should take pity upon all the fools who were unfortunate enough to challenge Vilgefortz in hand-to-hand combat, for the outcome of the bout would have surely been determined long before the first⁠—and often last⁠—blow of the mage’s staff landed.
reward_tree_ep7_nilfgaard_story_pt1;Vilgefortz of Roggeveen was an exceptionally powerful mage, a veteran of the Battle of Sodden Hill, and a member of the Chapter of Wizards—at least, until its dissolution in the bloody aftermath of the Thanedd Coup, of which he was a prime instigator.
reward_tree_ep7_nilfgaard_story_pt2;Strikingly handsome, devilishly intelligent, and skilled beyond his years, Vilgefortz commanded the admiration and respect of all those who knew him. It’s no surprise that many of his peers were envious of his fortunate position, yet, for him, these attributes were not nearly enough to sate his lofty aspirations. He wanted far, far more.
reward_tree_ep7_nilfgaard_story_pt3;Indeed, Vilgefortz was a vehemently ambitious man; his actions largely dictated by an unrelenting drive to become the most powerful being in the world⁠—and perhaps across all space and time, if one could even fathom such an authority.

Besides, it was difficult for non-believers to openly reject the Mother’s benevolence, as such heresy would be considered an insult. This, of course, was an especially dangerous stance to take, as the sisters had established an annual night of celebration dedicated to their mother⁠—and with the celebration came sacrifices of blood. Ironically, it was on one of these nights that the daughters later killed their mother, burying her body deep within the marshes. However, the ancient witch’s soul refused to leave in peace, and so the sisters used dark magic to imprison it within the boughs of a great oak, where it remained for many years, idle and powerless.
reward_tree_ep7_shewhoknows_chest_2;For centuries, the Lady of the Wood’s spirit remained trapped beneath the great oak upon the hillock, crying and wailing in frustration as it wandered eternally through a maze of boughs⁠—a prison within a labyrinth of leaves. Unable to escape from the fetters of magic that held it, the spirit raved, thrashing the gnarly branches of the oak, killing all those who dared approach⁠—men, women, and children alike. One day, a wanderer stumbled upon the hidden cavern beneath the oak and decided to end the curse of the Whispering Hillock⁠—an act that would see the Mother’s ghost finally released from its accursed shackles. To this day, it is often debated as to whether the wanderer released the spirit back into the world or simply destroyed it. Either way, the great oak upon the hillock now stands in calm serenity.
reward_tree_ep7_shewhoknows_chest_3;There are those that say an ancient spirit roams the woodlands of Velen⁠—a gale galloping in the body of a beautiful black steed. Most importantly, it is known among the locals that one should be wary if they happen upon the horse⁠—an ethereal silhouette with red eyes burning bright.⁠ The beast, you see, brings madness. All who get too close to the creature are stricken with a potent mania⁠—an unrelenting drive to do harm most violent to themselves and others. Tales have often been shared of loved ones brutally slaying each other in the wake of meeting the beast, unable to still their frenzied bloodlust. But such things should not be feared, for it is said that the spirit avoids all confrontation, and one would have to go looking quite specifically for the creature to find it. And one with a desire to do such a thing, of course, must already be quite mad.
reward_tree_ep7_shewhoknows_story_pt1;There are many things she knew, and some things only she knew, for the Lady of the Wood was a being as enigmatic as the origin of life itself⁠—and just as old⁠—for her age far exceeded even the most exaggerated legend of her heritage. With this long life came incomprehensible wisdom, but the knowledge gained from such longevity could not be hailed entirely as a blessing, as behind the veil of enlightenment lay discontent, along with a dormant madness waiting to stir...
reward_tree_ep7_shewhoknows_story_pt2;The witch was obsessed with discovering the meaning of existence and journeyed throughout the world in search of answers. For centuries she roamed, soaking up all knowledge until there was no secret left unknown to her. Yet, the more wisdom she amassed, the more hollow and unfulfilled she felt⁠—a cruel conundrum and one she simply could not hope to solve. That is, not until a magnificent cataclysm split reality itself and brought forth strange creatures into the world, along with powerful magic.
reward_tree_ep7_shewhoknows_story_pt3;Even though many new beings had come from the Conjunction, there were still none like herself, and therein, she mused, might lie the answer to her anguish. Perhaps the empty feeling she felt was loneliness, and her search was not a search for enlightenment but for companionship. Thus, using the mystical forces brought by the cataclysm, she mixed her blood with mud and sculpted three beings from the clay—three daughters made in her image, to comfort her and carry forth her legacy.
reward_tree_ep7_shewhoknows_story_pt4;With her daughters, she ruled over a moory land called Velen, worshipped as a goddess by the locals. Yet contentment still eluded her, and soon she spiraled into utter despair. The endless pursuit of purpose had finally broken her, and she was slowly consumed by an insatiable madness. Her mania, augmented by the powers she possessed, gushed forth like a poisoned spring, defiling Velen and infecting all those who lived there. Soon, chaos consumed the land, and it teetered on the precipice of ruin. Thus, the three daughters decided to end their mother’s life and, with it, the all-consuming madness.

reward_tree_ep7_syndicate_chest_pt1;Octavia Hale had always wished to be a thespian. She had adored the idea of donning fancy clothing, slipping inside another persona, and enthralling audiences with a showcase of her performative prowess. But having children at a young age had promptly halted those desires, for she was a realist and knew full well the pursuit of such dreams would not provide for her sons. And so, she delayed such aspirations… Until, one day, she stumbled upon a way to rekindle her passion for performance and make herself wealthy in the process. She assumed the role of the Witchfinder. Captivating unknowing audiences with her spiel and splendor, she bent them to her sordid will and compelled them to pay for the pleasure. Yet, wealth, it turned out, was simply not enough. She wanted to become a living legend and build a legacy in her wake. And so she soon embodied the character she had created in its entirety, incorporating it into her own persona. She lived her life as the Witchfinder from dawn till dusk⁠, becoming less cautious and more brazen as the years passed. Eventually, she caught the attention of an actual witch, and the whole charade came crashing down around her.
reward_tree_ep7_syndicate_chest_pt2;When one spends their time lurking in the shadows, one tends to become a shady character⁠—yet, ‘shady’ would be far too kind of a descriptor for Fabian Hale. In order to rustle up business, Octavia often tasked him with spreading rumors, sowing seeds of doubt, and staging the occasional crime scene. But it was very difficult for the ‘Little Scoundrel,’ as his mother took to calling him, to stop there. With an insatiable quench for violent desires, he would often exploit his position to exercise the savage within—indeed, many a convicted ‘witch’ mysteriously disappeared before ever making it to the pyre. With this penchant for predatory behavior, coupled with a complete lack of morals, the extent of the younger Hale brother’s depravity is best not discussed openly, for fear of inducing nausea in all those who hear word of his dastardly deeds.
reward_tree_ep7_syndicate_chest_pt3;Often dubbed ‘The Brute,’ for obvious reasons, Ignatius⁠—or ‘Iggy,’ as he preferred to be called⁠—was the muscle of the Hale operation. His duties, which he performed with unwavering zeal, were to round up wrongdoers accused of witchcraft, extract their confessions, and burn them alive upon a pyre⁠—preferably with a large crowd to bear witness. Yet, one shouldn’t make the mistake of thinking Ignatius an entirely bad person. On the contrary, he was a hero⁠—or, at least, that’s what he genuinely believed. Since being kicked in the head by a mule as a child, he had been rather dimwitted and very easy to manipulate. So, his mother, knowing the boundlessness of his good nature, convinced him that the Hales were indeed hunting genuine witches, punishing evil, and saving innocent folks from terrible fates. Otherwise, she feared, the kind-hearted and simple-minded oaf would surely give up their ruse in a heartbeat.
reward_tree_ep7_syndicate_story_pt1;Hailing from a far corner of the Nilfgaardian Empire, the Hale family immigrated to the Northern Realms in search of fame and fortune⁠—both of which they found in pursuit of the most unlikely and cruel of endeavors.
reward_tree_ep7_syndicate_story_pt2;Octavia Hale had grown up amid an assimilation of culture from a foreign power, and so was no stranger to prejudice. Yet, the sheer passion for persecution she witnessed upon arrival in Novigrad baffled her beyond comprehension. The locals had shown a burning hatred towards magical folk, and in seeing them jeer lustfully during a public execution, a sinister scheme formed in her mind.
reward_tree_ep7_syndicate_story_pt3;Many folks, it seemed, needed something⁠—or someone⁠—to blame for any misfortune or misery that befell them. Thus, Octavia and her two sons donned the personas of renowned witch hunters and set about delivering to the provinces of the Northern Realms exactly what they so desperately craved: scapegoats.
reward_tree_ep7_syndicate_story_pt4;Real mages, however, were a rather dangerous affair⁠⁠—especially when one lacked access to magic-suppressing compounds like dimeritium. Besides, they were relatively scarce beings. Therefore, the Hales opted for a safer and more productive undertaking. Venturing throughout the land, they preyed on the ignorance of isolated communities by fabricating acts of witchcraft, framing innocent villagers, and then most generously proffering their witch-hunting services⁠. For a fee, of course…

reward_tree_eredin_chest_1;Eredin had but one goal – to open the gate between worlds. Was he to succeed, he would have eliminated the need to traverse realms of frenetic timelessness and bitter cold. The Aen Elle could seize control of the Continent and at last escape their doomed world. In such a scenario, the folk of the Continent would likely haved longed for their former kings – even those considered tyrants and whoresons...
reward_tree_eredin_chest_2;Eredin made great effort to leverage human legends and superstitions. For this reason, his riders wore ghostly armor to appear as specters. What's more, he haunted the waters of Skellige with a ship resembling Naglfar, the mythical drakkar storied to be constructed from the nails of the dead. Due to his fear-mongering tactics, Eredin's Wild Hunt riders rarely had need to draw their weapons. They simply watched as their foes dropped their own...
reward_tree_eredin_chest_3;Eredin has many foul deeds on his conscience – regicide included. Believing that the Aen Elle's leader, Auberon, was too weak to lead their people to victory, he decided to eliminate the king and take his place. While his plot succeeded, Eredin's reign would not last long, for it wasn't long before he stood against a particular witcher of the Wolf School by name of Geralt of Rivia...

reward_tree_fancesca_chest_1;According to the provisions of the Cintrian peace agreement, sovereignty of Dol Blathanna would fall to the elves. However, the treaty did not specify in what condition. With this loophole kept well in mind, all those fleeing the valley carried what they could and burned the rest. In place of her beloved Valley of Flowers, Francesca Findabair inherited a Valley of Ashes.
reward_tree_fancesca_chest_2;Francesca sought to return the Valley of Flowers to its former glory, though her aim would prove far more difficult than she had anticipated. Razed palaces can be rebuilt, scorched gardens can be recultivated. Yet after years of exile, the elves had forgotten many of their time-honored traditions and customs, instead soaking in human culture. It seemed Dol Blathanna would never regain its former identity.
reward_tree_fancesca_chest_3;Francesca realized that one false move could once again bring ruin upon the Valley of Flowers. Thus, she patiently tolerated her neighbors' incessant provocation. However, were any to cross the border into Dol Blathanna, Francesca would stop at nothing to defend her realm and subjects.
reward_tree_fancesca_story_pt1;Francesca Findabair, known also by her true name Enid an Gleanna, is widely regarded as the Continent's most beautiful woman – elf or otherwise. Yet she is also its saddest – all due to her dream fulfilled...
reward_tree_fancesca_story_pt2;Francesca desired one thing above all – to reclaim Dol Blathanna, the Valley of Flowers, from human hands and rebuild the kingdom of elves. The North's war with Nilfgaard destroyed the old order and opened the door for her dream to be realized. The price to pay, however, was great indeed...
reward_tree_fancesca_story_pt3;In order to regain Dol Blathanna, Francesca had no choice but to enter an alliance with Emperor Emhyr var Emreis of Nilfgaard. And when the time came for peace negotiations, she was to deliver captured Scoia'tael officers for punishment at the Imperial court.
reward_tree_fancesca_story_pt4;Francesca had no doubt she made the right decision – dozens of soldiers in exchange for the fate of her people. The sheer number of lives at stake suggest she made the humane choice, yet solace cannot always be found in cold calculation.
reward_tree_filavandrel_chest_1;When the kingdom of elves fell to ruin, Filavandrel found refuge in the Blue Mountains, at the edge of the world, far from human settlements. There, surrounded with rubble and mountain pine, he longed for the day he could return to his beloved Valley of Flowers... And the luxuries with which it overflowed.
reward_tree_filavandrel_chest_2;The White Ships – words belonging to one of Filavandrel's many titles – are a reference to the vessels on which the elves first arrived to the Continent. Yes, yes... The noble Aen Seidhe were not this world's first inhabitants. A fact they are reluctant to admit... Likely because the cruelty they inflicted upon the land's indigenous races bears a striking resemblance to humans' callous treatment of elves several hundred years later.
reward_tree_filavandrel_chest_3;Filavandrel has many reasons to be proud. Among them is the fact that he once belonged to a small group who managed to best the legendary Geralt of Rivia in battle. He stood poised to kill the witcher, but his hand was stayed by the sudden appearance of Dana Méadbh, an elven goddess who abhors bloodshed. Had she not intervened, the fate of the world might have turned out rather differently...
reward_tree_filavandrel_story_pt1;Filavandrel nearly always insisted that he be addressed by his full name – Filavandrel aén Fidháil of the Silver Towers and House of Feleaorn of the White Ships. Perhaps his insistance says more about him that the list of titles itself.
reward_tree_filavandrel_story_pt2;Unlike most elves, Filavandrel never experienced life under human yoke. He never endured the humiliation of descrimination nor the fear of pogroms. He bore the proud expression of one who was never beaten down nor forced to bend knee.

reward_tree_foltest_chest_1;Unlike the other kings of the North, Foltest did not hate the Elder Races. On the contrary, he spoke fluent Elder Speech and was a connoisseur of elven poetry and dwarven ale. Nevertheless, he fought against the Squirrels with unbridled ruthlessness. He sentenced every prisoner of war to the breaking wheel, considered sympathetic humans as spies, and confined all non-humans to segregated city quarters. "After all," he thought, "reasons of state sometimes demand sacrifices."
reward_tree_foltest_chest_2;Foltest claimed dozens of wartime victories – often against overwhelming enemy forces. What was his secret to success? An analytical mind? Swift and decisive action? The king himself used to say that he owed his many victories to an excellent memory. For he knew the names of all his officers – even many of the rank-and-file. He understood their strengths and weaknesses, thus enabling him to assign the right person to any task. As a result, most in Foltest's service considered themselves friends to the king. And all were prepared to give their life for him.
reward_tree_foltest_chest_3;King Foltest was not particularly religious as rulers go. He did not observe fasts nor venture out on pilgrimages. In fact, often without a second thought, he had broken all religious edicts concerning one's private affairs in the alcove. Nevertheless, he spared no expense when it came to erecting new temple and even agreed to a tithe, proving a significant drain on the royal treasury. Yet, to what end? Although he doubted the existence of the gods, he recognized that the power of their priests was very real. Any attempt to limit their influence might provoke their holy wrath...
reward_tree_foltest_story_pt1;Foltest seemed the ideal ruler. Intelligent, generous, industrious, and – according to all accounts – devilishly handsome. Yet, none are free of fault. Especially kings...
reward_tree_foltest_story_pt2;In Foltest's case, his failing was excessive amorousness. Indeed, the Lord of Temeria, Pontar, Mahakam, and Sodden could not control himself in matters of the flesh.
reward_tree_foltest_story_pt3;If only Foltest had limited his conquests of love to bored widows and adventurous townswomen... Alas, he preferred to chase after priestesses, the wives of his allies, and the daughters of friends... Even his own sister.
reward_tree_foltest_story_pt4;Foltest's uninhibited lust proved his ultimate downfall. The King of Temeria – a celebrated hero of the Nilfgaard wars – did not fall at Sodden or Brenna. No... Rather, he perished in the midst of civil war against a former lover and their bastard children.

reward_tree_gernichora_chest_1;Gernichora, as the legend goes, was once a princess on her way to wed one of King Cedric's sons in Vizima when her retinue ran adrift in Angren, engulfed by the treacherous swamps of Ysgith. The princess, at the last possible moment, caught hold of a nearby tree root before the bog's thick mud could swallow her up. Desperate for help, she screamed and screamed, yet there wasn't a soul for miles. Others arrived at her side, however. The princess was quickly overwhelmed by hundreds of leeches that drained her body down to the last drop of blood. Then, enveloped in the mysterious power of Ysgith's swamps, the princess was reborn – a monster.
reward_tree_gernichora_chest_2;Gernichora was, in fact, a post-Conjunction monster whose name derives from the Elder Speech. The elves called her Gvaern Ichaer – the Bloody Mistress. The Aen Seidhe, though incapable of defeating Gernichora, did their best to limit her power. When the last elves left Angren, their warnings fell on deaf ears. It wasn't long before the effects of local ignorance and negligance were felt...
reward_tree_gernichora_chest_3;Many rulers have attempted to harness the power of Ysgith: first the Temerians, followed by the Nilfgaardians. Drawn by its potential, they sent vast settler caravans – heavily guarded, of course – into the tepid swamps. But the end result was always the same: affliction, insanity, and the stench of mass graves to whet the appetite of nearby ghouls. Ysgith largely remains uninhabited, and perhaps that's for the best.
reward_tree_gernichora_story_pt1;Angren is one of the most treacherous regions of the Continent... And Ysgith is the most dangerous locale within Angren. It is there one can find the lair of the horrifying monstrosity known to locals as Gernichora.
reward_tree_gernichora_story_pt2;According to some, Gernichora appears as a tall woman, covered head to toe in blood-gorged leeches. Others claim she resembles a siren, though with the abdomen of a leech in place of a fish tail. The debate is likely to rage on, however, as no one who's had the pleasure to examine the beast firsthand has ever returned alive.
reward_tree_gernichora_story_pt3;Nevertheless, the inhabitant of Angren's marshes are well-acquainted with her most iconic trait: the fruits of Ysgith. From afar they appear to be thirst-quenching apples – so plump, red, and juicy that the branches bend under their weight... Yet whenever a wayward traveler—delirious with hunger—reaches for one, he grabs naught but an enormous leech, engorged on blood near to the point of bursting.
reward_tree_gernichora_story_pt4;Gernichora's not wholly unlike a vampire, though rather than feast on the blood of others, she feeds them with her own. She latches parasites to her body, then dangles them from trees. Then any beast or monster which tastes of her fruits shall become completely subservient to her will...

reward_tree_griffin_2_story_chest;For many years Jerome lived with his destiny, feeling no anger or regret about it, with no desire to reverse the mutations. Long had he felt his father’s scheming shadow. So when professor Moreau lured him to Toussaint with a contract, he decided to put an end to this charade.\nJerome confronted professor Moreau in 1121. After imprisoning the witcher using a paralyzing spell, he proceeded with mad and reckless experiments to free his son from the witcher’s mutations. Utterly ignoring his son’s contrary pleas for mercy.\nThis process was not mild. Not at all.\nBrought to the brink of death on many occasions, he rose every time faster and stronger than before. And more… mutated. As a result of old Moreau’s experiments and in spite of his determination, Jerome became less and less human. Until the eighth day of autumn in 1122, the professor finally gave up. He collected his notes and closed his laboratory.\nAs for the remains of his failed subject...\nHe just burnt them, unwilling to face what he had done ever again.
reward_tree_griffin_2_story_pt1;In 1087, after saving professor Tomas Moreau, a witcher demanded that which the scholar already had, but did not know of. From this day forward, Jerome, son of Tomas, became one of the children bound by the Law of Surprise.
reward_tree_griffin_2_story_pt2;A few years later, the witcher came for young Jerome to take him to Kaer Seren, the home of the School of the Griffin. The boy was subjected to the usual physical training and mutations necessary to forge a witcher. Yet the process seemed mild to him as if he was particularly well suited for it.
reward_tree_griffin_2_story_pt3;As a result, he mostly resembled an ordinary man, leaving only his silver sword and Griffin medallion to prove the contrary. Strangers and friends alike treated him better than the average witcher, with many failing to realize the fact that a mutant stood before them.
reward_tree_griffin_2_story_pt4;Unfortunately, extraordinary resistance was to become Jerome's undoing. For professor Moreau did not forget about his lost son, keeping him under constant observation. His normalcy led to his father’s belief that the mutations could still be reversed.

reward_tree_griffin_avatar_chest_1;Although George of Kagen belonged to the School of the Griffin, his likeness can be found immortalized on the walls of Kaer Morhen, the seat of the Wolf School. The Wolf School's mentors believed a depiction of George's triumph over a dragon would prove a valuable point of study for their witchers-in-training. By facing the scaly foe alone, the witcher demonstrated great courage. Yet, in the bitter end, George's misguided faith in the virtues of men served as a tale of caution for the future monster slayers. Alas, the fresco of the famed dragonslayer was treated by the young Wolves as little more than a open canvas on which to sketch curly mustaches, bushy beards, and other features of the male anatomy...
reward_tree_griffin_avatar_story_pt1;Word has circled far and wide that witchers refuse to accept contracts on dragons as the scaled behemoths are not only sentient, but highly intelligent beings. Indeed, the Continent's most famous monster slayer, Geralt of Rivia, closely adhered to this principle. Yet, his brother-in-arms from the Griffin School, George of Kagen, followed no such tenet...
reward_tree_griffin_avatar_story_pt2;Witchers and experienced blacksmiths alike highly prized the School of the Griffin's exceptionally durable armor. Perhaps to a fault. For George believed his breastplate, forged from Mahakam steel, would protect him from dragon fire and noxious poisons. Alas, even Dwarven smithing cannot work miracles...
reward_tree_griffin_avatar_story_pt3;The gargantuan draconid that had long ravaged the lands of Velen proved to be no less than a green dragon – and George's final adversary. Though he managed to fell the dragon, the witcher suffered grave wounds. Still, he might have survived... were it not for the depravity of man.
reward_tree_griffin_avatar_story_pt4;A certain Balstick, a peasant of Velen and a man of conflicted morals, pledged his care for the maimed witcher. Alas, the peasant's wishes for a brighter future outshined this gesture of goodwill. Rather than nuture George back to life, Balstick sought to ease the dragonslayer's passing by diluting his remedies and slipping wolfsbane into his food.

reward_tree_griffin_border_chest_1;Legend tells that Valerian Papebrock of Temeria, who lived in the time of King Desmond, once attempted to domesticate griffins. He had dreamt to one day soar the heavens atop the regal beast that adorned his family's crest. Then one day, lured by the promise of ample reward, a mysterious man appeared at Papebrock's court to offer an enormous egg of nearly five pounds – an egg he claimed to have plucked from a griffin's nest. In three weeks' time, a strange creature finally emerged from that egg, though a griffin it certainly was not. It resembled a great goose with powerful, naked legs and a long, flimsy neck. The beast never did allow Valerian to ride atop its back, though its succulent meat did become a topic of great conversation and a point of pride for the Papebrock family at their next banquet.
reward_tree_griffin_border_story_pt1;In the past, griffins were known to limit their territory to the high mountains where they hunted marmots and goats. However, in more recent memory, the hybrid monsters extended their range to the plains, for they had learned that sheep were less nimble prey. And their shepherds even more so...
reward_tree_griffin_border_story_pt2;It is common knowledge that griffins pair for life and will defend their mates at any cost. For this reason, they often serve as a symbol for courage, loyalty, and valor.
reward_tree_griffin_border_story_pt3;It should come as no surprise, then, that the griffin appears on many coats of arms across much of the Continent, such as in the Kingdom of Caingorn and in families such as the Papebrocks of Temeria. In fact, the beast's admirable traits are so well respected that the monster even became the symbol for a school of monster slayers...
reward_tree_griffin_border_story_pt4;Little is known about the School of the Griffin. Its precise location remains unknown and only three witchers from the school have been recorded in the annals of the Continent's history: George of Kagen, Jerome Moreau, and a third, unnamed witcher who reportedly fell to the blade of Leo Bonhart.

Nowadays, whenever prudent Novigradians hear something clank and scrape across their roofs, they quickly gather their most valuable possessions and hurry to lock themselves in the cellar.
reward_tree_gudrun_chest_2;On the Skellige Isles, women and men stand on equal footing. Both learn the arts of war and seafaring. Despite this widespread knowledge of Skellige's customs, many mainland folk give a snort and a wink at the sight of Skellige's warrior women, thinking their weapons serve merely as decorative trinkets. Gudrun has always relished opportunities to personally educate folk on the consequences of their ignorance.
reward_tree_gudrun_chest_3;Many Novigradians have tried to woo the beauteous pirate's heart with exquisite floral bouquets and romantic ballads. Despite these persistent efforts, Gudrun always firmly rejected their advances, for her heart had belonged to someone else...

reward_tree_harald_chest_1;Harald an Craite was easy to spot on the battlefield due, in part, to his limp. Perhaps more noticeable, however, was his iconic helmet decorated with ram horns. Apparently, this one piece of armor weighed nearly two stones. When asked if such a helmet was practical, Harald answered simply, "If you don't train your neck, sooner or later it'll bend to someone." Though his actual language was much more... colorful.
reward_tree_harald_chest_2;Harald's hair greyed at a young age – a consequence of his visit to the Cave of Dreams. The cavern is known to Skelligers as a mystical place that confronts you with your greatest fear. What Harald witnessed in those caves, no one knows for certain... But some close to the king claimed he saw himself.
reward_tree_harald_chest_3;Harald never wielded a shield in battle. He entered the fray only ever with a sword in one hand and a bloodred banner in the other. He was of the mind that shields offer a false sense of safety and security. Indeed, Harald believed battle could be reduced to a single, fundamental choice – charge or die.
reward_tree_harald_story_pt1;At an early point in his life, Harald was merely a warrior of average skill. That is, until a bear shattered his leg – an injury that never healed properly. He was left with an intense, lingering pain for the remainder of his days... Yet, since that fateful day, he fought more ferociously than ever before.
reward_tree_harald_story_pt2;Perhaps because he endured constant pain, day and night, he understood it better than any other ever could. His capacity to inflict suffering likewise grew, for he knew precisely where to strike and how to cause the greatest agony imaginable.
reward_tree_harald_story_pt3;Harald had a notorious reputation among many on the Isles. Not because he plundered and murdered, for any self-respecting Skelliger would often do the same. But rather because he did not give his foes a chance to receive an honorable death. Unrelentingly, he inflicted horrible suffering until they squirmed in pain at his feet, begging him pathetically for mercy.

reward_tree_henselt_chest_1;Fate has a twisted sense of humor and Henselt was one of its many victims. The King of Kaedwen often enjoyed boasting of his virility. Following several mugs of stout, he once proudly whispered to a confidant that he had fathered enough bastard children to fill all the thrones of the North – perhaps even several Nilfgaardian provinces. However, after his only legitimate heir died on a hunting expedition, the king failed to beget another successor to the throne – despite his many attempts. Some say it was Henselt's failures in the royal bedchambers that contributed to his explosive temperament...
reward_tree_henselt_chest_2;Henselt did not have kingly countenance. Beady, wandering eyes. A bulbous, red nose. A large, bushy beard... Such a description better suits a bandit than one of the North's most prominent monarchs. Aware of less-than-noble visage, Henselt carefully curated his grand and stately attire, always taking care to bear the royal insignia. He wore an immense belt adorned with silver towers, a fifteen-ounce chain of solid gold, a crown topped with the royal unicorn, and a crimson kaftan exquisitely trimmed with weasel fur. But, as King Foltest used to say with a smile on his face, "A hog festooned with gold remains a hog all the same."
reward_tree_henselt_chest_3;Henselt long refused to accept mages and sorceresses into his court. Though, in the end, he eventually included Sabrina Glevissig among his advisors, albeit not as a source of advice, but as yet another symbol of power – much like an ermine coat or golden scepter. Her role in the Kaedweni court was of the cosmetic variety. However, Sabrina refused to stay silent – sometimes silencing her king with a shout or by pounding her fists on the table. In time, she earned Henselt's recognition, but never forgot about the insults and disdain that first greeted her. Years later, when the opportunity struck, Sabrina betrayed the king... An offense for which she paid the ultimate price.
reward_tree_henselt_story_pt1;King Henselt did not inspire awe with his bandit-like countenance. He did not dazzle ballroom crowds with charisma. He did not impress courtiers with refinement... Yet on the battlefield, one could see a master at work.
reward_tree_henselt_story_pt2;Henselt was capable of determining a catapult's range down to an inch. He walked amongst his siege machines not unlike a proud father – affectionately patting the stones, plucking at the taut ropes as would a troubador with his harp...
reward_tree_henselt_story_pt3;Worse was when his attention shifted away from matters of war, for Henselt preferred the company of his siege machines to that of man. He was quick to anger... But not quick to calm.
reward_tree_henselt_story_pt4;As a result, despite his undisputed talent on the battlefield, Kaedwen's power did not grow under Henselt's leadership. He failed to gain allies and turn his military victories into lasting successes. Though this did not bother the king, as he waged war for its own sake.

The only things dear to him were the sweet jingle of gold and the metallic taste of blood. To see the red sails of his drakkar, "The Terror of the Seas", it was like hearing one's death sentence.

Tales of what she did to the young prince make one's blood run cold. How much truth there is to these stories, no one knows.

reward_tree_junior_chest_1;Scholars, philosophers, and religious figures have debated since the dawn of time what can cause a man to become evil. His nature, his upbringing, perhaps black magic or poisons? In Whoreson Junior's case, it was a thick leather belt which his father lashed at him for any reason at all... And sometimes even in the absence of one. Years of fear, pain and humiliation scarred the young Cyprian Wiley. Horrible years for which the people of Novigrad must now pay the price.

reward_tree_leszy_chest_1;In some regions of the world, cults are formed around leshens. They are offered sacrifices, usually in the form of hares and birds, but sometimes human blood. Many legends have emerged of benevelont leshens that help hunters find prey, guide wayward travelers to safety, even rescue folk from bandit raids. Unfortunately, not a shred of truth can be found in such myths. In fact, leshes see humans as just another source of energy – a source for which their appetites continue to grow.
reward_tree_leszy_chest_2;For years, scholars have debated the true nature of leshens. Although most bestiaries categorize them as relicts, many experts question this classification. Some consider them a being born of black magic, perhaps even necromancy. Others contend that they are demons, akin to djinns or draugs. Autopsies of leshen corpses would undoubtedly shed light on the dispute. However, once slain, its body vanishes... All that remains is of the creature is a yellowed deer skull...
reward_tree_leszy_chest_3;What should one do upon encountering a leshen? Fighting it is out of the question – unless you are an experienced witcher, of course. Naturally, the first instinct would be to flee. Unfortunately, leshens can move between trees at the speed of the wind, making escape nearly impossible. So what is the alternative? Hunters, druids, and elves all agree – any traveler who stumbles upon a leshen should fall to his knees without delay, draw a blade over his wrists, and close his eyes. If fortune smiles upon him, the leshen will be satisfied with the gift of blood and leave the traveler be... And perhaps his wounds can be healed before it is too late.

reward_tree_love_2_story_chest;In 1272, Dandelion and Vespula got back together for a short time, before she once again threw him out on his rear. After her fickle relationship with the bard, love eluded her for many years, and a plethora of dubious men found themselves beneath her balcony, dodging the barrage of "gifts". Finally, Vespula met Silent Yanko, who⁠—as it soon turned out⁠—was deaf. She was smitten and fell in love with him instantly.\nYanko, unlike Dandelion, was a man who really understood her. She just loved talking with him. Or rather, to him.
reward_tree_love_2_story_pt1;Vespula and Dandelion's breakup was the same as their relationship: swift and stormy. As a farewell, the woman gave the troubadour a few parting gifts⁠—a jar of preserve, a chipped pot, a tin cup, and someone else's trousers... She threw them all at him from the heights of her flowery balcony, together with his beloved lute, which Dandelion caught at the last moment before it could smash against the cobbles.
reward_tree_love_2_story_pt2;Vespula did not spare insults against her former lover. She called him a lousy bastard, a devil's son, a lying sloven, and a croaking pheasant. She exclaimed that he was absolutely good for nothing in bed. The whole mess resulted from a simple misunderstanding, and due to Dandelion and Vespula's disagreement on a certain issue: monogamy.
reward_tree_love_2_story_pt3;Geralt witnessed the latter half of this row when he visited Novigrad for a new jacket. Later, after they'd popped in to the Spear Blade tavern to calm Dandelion's nerves, the witcher and the bard ran into Vespula once again. In quite unusual circumstances. A certain doppler had transformed into Dandelion in order to blend in amid the market's crowd. A misunderstanding was inevitable...
reward_tree_love_2_story_pt4;Mimicking Dandelion, the doppler played his lute, grinning at the passing girls. Suddenly, Vespula appeared, still furious and brandishing a sizeable copper pan. Unsuspecting of her intention, the creature greeted Vespula warmly instead of running away, and was promptly bonked over the head. Enticed by the sound of his lute and with a slender step, the real Dandelion appeared on the scene. At the mere sight of the second bard, the terrified Vespula ran away in a fit of panic.\nJust another love story.

reward_tree_love_avatar_chest_1;Dandelion relished any opportunity to mention that he graduated from the prestigious Oxenfurt Academy. That said, he always failed to disclose that a three-year baccalaureate took him nearly a decade to complete due, in part, to three suspensions. What's more, toward the end of his studies, he was also ordered to remain at all times at least one hundred feet from the alchemy department – a rather lenient punishment considering his failed experiments nearly reduced it to cinders...
reward_tree_love_avatar_chest_2;Many who knew Dandelion considered him a licentious rake, among other things. Sigismund Dijkstra, former head of the Redanian intelligence service, once remarked that although the troubadour was aged over forty years, he looked like he was thirty, imagined he was twenty, and behaved like he was ten. To those who knew him best, however, it was apparent that the famous poet was shrewder that he often let on.
reward_tree_love_avatar_chest_3;Though Dandelion was most famous as a poet and a bard, he was quite the jack of all trades. He once owned a tavern in Novigrad, lectured at Oxenfurt, and even tried his hand as an informant. While inspired in small part by a patriotic sense of duty, he ultimately viewed espionage and intrigue as a way to enhance his repertoire of seductive charms. For a time, Dandelion sent reports to the Redanian intelligence service. Granted, their usefulness was questionable, and fact tended to blend with fiction. Contrary to his claims, Dandelion's contributions to intelligence and security proved greatly exaggerated.
reward_tree_love_avatar_story_pt1;Like most artists, Dandelion was deeply moved by beauty. He could be utterly carried away by the mosaic of dancing light on morning dew, the melodious trills of songbirds, and the soft rustling of reeds in a summer's breeze... Though what took his breath away most was that gentle curve leading from slim waist to firm derrière.
reward_tree_love_avatar_story_pt2;Dandelion had dozens, if not hundreds of lovers. Yet one must admit he was unusually egalitarian in his romantic pursuits. Whether revered duchess or humble washerwoman, Dandelion admired all womankind.
reward_tree_love_avatar_story_pt3;On numerous occasions, Dandelion was forced to flee from gentleman caught in a fury, their faces crimson and eyes burning with hatred. At sight of the bard running terrified through the streets, gracious townswomen opened their doors left and right, offering sanctuary... And thus the cycle began anew.
reward_tree_love_avatar_story_pt4;Eventually, Dandelion met his match. After years of flirts, romances, and affairs – with many a broken heart left in his wake – Dandelion discovered the love of his life...

For the price of one crown-filled purse, they could experience a moment of purest ecstasy and intoxication in the arms of their chosen lover ...
reward_tree_love_border_chest_3;There's a saying among witchers: the greater the affection, the greater the affliction. Indeed, many monstrosities are born of love, in some manner at least. Curses cast by spurned lovers can possess incredible power and can bind the souls of their victims even after death, condemning them to roam the world of the living as wraiths...
reward_tree_love_border_story_pt1;It is often said that love knows no bounds. On the Continent, however, the truth is far less poetic. Everyone knows their place. Aristocrats are forbidden to consort with common folk, and humans likewise with elves. Though there is one notable exception to the rule... Belleteyn.

reward_tree_magic_2_chest;The Brotherhood of Sorcerers seized most of the princesses allegedly affected by the Curse of the Black Sun. Stregobor personally performed post-mortem examinations on many, with most deaths during the experiments... None of those experiments brought the expected results. While the princesses had some mutations in their bodies, Stregobor found nothing conclusively proving his claims: they bled like a human, suffered like a human, and died just like a human would.\nYet one escaped his grasp. Renfri, princess of Creyden, also known as the Shrike. For years she was begging, lying, stealing, and even selling herself, just to survive. When she finally grew stronger and had gathered her own group of highwaymen, Renfri began to seek revenge at all costs... In the end, she was prepared to pay the highest price. In order to get her hands on Stregobor, she was ready to slaughter a whole city. A white-haired witcher prevented this from happening, killing not only Renfri, but every member of the Shrike’s crew. Ironically, this act of valiance only netted him the moniker: the Butcher of Blaviken.\nMeanwhile, Stregobor escaped - free of guilt and punishment.
reward_tree_magic_2_story_pt1;Stregobor looked like a wizard plucked straight out of a fairy tale: gray, bearded, hunched, a long staff in hand, and always wearing dark, trailing robes with wide sleeves. One could say: a dignified appearance indeed. But in reality, no self-respecting sorcerer would be caught alive wearing such clothes and accessories. Except for Stregobor, of course.
reward_tree_magic_2_story_pt2;Stregobor was widely renowned for his incredibly realistic illusions. The flowers he conjured smelled sweet, apples could be eaten, bees stung painfully, and beautiful girls did absolutely everything that their creator wanted. It has been said that this last detail was the main motivator for Stregobor’s research into illusions. But the sorcerer himself strongly denied such allegations.
reward_tree_magic_2_story_pt3;Illusions weren’t Stregobor’s only strength. He was also able to calm or create storms, precisely controlling the winds or clouds. However, his greatest passion was poured into researching the Curse of the Black Sun.
reward_tree_magic_2_story_pt4;The Brotherhood of Sorcerers, largely due to Stregobor’s urging, imprisoned in towers and - more or less intentionally - killed dozens of young girls born from royal families. According to the prophecies, exactly sixty princesses were supposed to be possessed by demons, cursed and tainted by the Black Sun. It was written that they will "fill the river valleys with blood". Written - but not proven.\nStregobor’s vials were ultimately the only thing to be filled with blood.

reward_tree_magic_avatar_chest_1;Many accused Yennefer of deceitful behavior. Admittedly, on a number of occasions the sorceress manipulated, twisted the truth, and made habit of quickly switching her allegiances. Yet in the end, it was revealed that she acted on behalf of a higher purpose. That is, on behalf of those she loved.
reward_tree_magic_avatar_chest_2;The childhood of famed sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg was never destined for happiness. The very fact that she was a quadroon – the daughter of a half-elf and a human – meant that she often fell victim to the contempt of her peers. What's more, Yennefer was born a hunchback, which proved reason enough for her own father to disown her – his little girl a monster in his eyes. Though later, as a pupil of Aretuza, she could at long last remove her aesthetic imperfections... Alas, her memories remained as vivid as ever.
reward_tree_magic_avatar_chest_3;Yennefer was a distinguished expert in the magical arts. Yet, unlike her colleagues, she didn't shy away from the darkest corners of magic. If one believes the rumors, Yennefer even dabbled in the strictly forbidden practice of necromancy. However, any criticism was met with a glowering stare and the same, cold reply: "The ends justify the means."
reward_tree_magic_avatar_story_pt1;Mages and sorceresses are individuals who possess incredible power, knowledge and, as is often the case, great ambition. Alas, their aspirations are rarely limited to the forbidden and arcane magical arts. Mages and sorceresses often indulge in political control through the monarchs they advise. For centuries, the most powerful court mages worked behind the scenes, exercising enormous influence on the Continent's political balance. However, everything changed with the ascendance of King Radovid V, the Stern, of Redania. Schools of magic were closed, and countless scrolls were cast into the flames, their contents forever lost to history.
reward_tree_magic_avatar_story_pt2;When King Radovid V began his murderous hunt for mages, Triss Merigold – like many of her colleagues – sought refuge in Novigrad, a neutral city. In place of a haven, however, she and the others found themselves cornered into a trap. Before long, the bodies of magic-wielders began to pile, their lives extinguished by the fanatical priests from the Church of the Eternal Fire. Those few lucky enough to be spared a gruesome death owe their thanks to Triss – not to mention a certain white-haired witcher.

reward_tree_mahakam_2_story_chest;Agility, keen senses, and a flair for card games weren't the only talents of Percival, and by far the most prominent. The gnome was, above all, an excellent metallurgist and jeweller, and established his first factory in the free city of Novigrad. Having bought a parrot from Zoltan—Field Marshal Duda—he made it a living advertisement, by teaching the bird to call out: "Brrrilliants, brrrrilliants!" And it worked! The gnome had a multitude of customers—his hands were full, and his purse was heavy with coin. With the boom in business, Schuttenbach opened another jewellery branch in Vizima, and the future of his entrepreneurial expansion seemed very bright indeed. Unfortunately, times changed, and not for the better...\nIn 1271, Percival left Novigrad due to racial persecution and moved his factory to Mount Carbon, the capital of Mahakam.
reward_tree_mahakam_2_story_pt1;Though he belonged to Zoltan's dwarven company, Percival Schuttenbach was not a dwarf. Instead of a bushy beard, he had a long, pointed nose that reliably marked the wearer's belonging to the old and noble race of gnomes.

And one common thread connected them all – each ended with bankruptcy and a torrent of strongly worded letters from outraged investors. Yet no amount of fiascos could convince him to stop trying. Surely, his next venture would at last make him a wealthy dwarf...
reward_tree_mahakam_avatar_chest_3;Zoltan's closest friend was a certain Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount of Lettenhove, more commonly known as Dandelion – a celebrated poet of the North. Together, they concocted elaborate business schemes and reveled in drunken debauchery for weeks at a time... Getting themselves into a good deal of trouble along the way.
reward_tree_mahakam_avatar_story_pt1;Mohawk, hearty laugh, fists like bread loaves, and – perched atop his shoulder – a uniquely foul-mouthed parrot. Zoltan Chivay was an adventurer, bouncer, and amateur bird trainer all in one. Truly, a dwarf like no other.
reward_tree_mahakam_avatar_story_pt2;Zoltan felt a deep, burning desire to do good. However, sensible that dwarf he was, Zoltan knew that he alone could not change the world for the better. Instead, he chose to do good only for himself and his immediate surroundings.
reward_tree_mahakam_avatar_story_pt3;Zoltan never hesitated to jump into the fire for his friends... Yet words such as "gods," "honor," and "fatherland" never made a strong impression on him or his motivations. To him they rang hollow, reminiscent of a mug drained of its ale.
reward_tree_mahakam_avatar_story_pt4;Zoltan's position regarding the Scoia'tael could be considered ambivalent. The promise of a better, brighter tomorrow never quite convinced him. That said, he never passed on an opportunity to kick a racist arse or two.

reward_tree_mahakam_border_chest_1;Many young dwarves dreamed of escaping Mahakam for a taste of freedom, in search of adventure. Elder-in-Chief Brouver Hoog was willing to compromise with the youngsters. After a dwarf's fiftieth birthday, he could leave Mahakam to experience human civilization for one year. However, should he not return before 365 days have elapsed, his name should be forever removed from the clan registry. When asked whether he feared that the realm's young dwarves would choose to never return, the Elder-in-Chief gave no response. He simply betrayed a knowing, yet bitter, smirk – for he knew how humans welcomed dwarves.
reward_tree_mahakam_border_chest_2;The dwarves of Mahakam love to revel in song, though almost exclusively in groups. Solo performances are considered the pinnacle of poor manners, yet even they have their place in society. Rival clans often resolve conflicts with yodelling duels. They gather on the slopes of Mount Carbon and vie to out-sing one another with dwarven classics such "Moonshiner Miner" and "Mind the Beard, Long-eared." Unfortunately, such duels often result in avalanches...
reward_tree_mahakam_border_chest_3;The sale of sihils and other fine blades for generations has Mahakam's vaults bursting with riches. Contrary to what most believe, however, ordinary dwarves do not have heavy pockets. Every coin earned from trade goes straight to Brouver Hoog – specifically, to a vault in the deepest levels beneath Mount Carbon. Dwarves receive all of life's necessities from their clan: robes, provisions, tools... Desire something more? Such an attitude won't get you far in Mahakam.
reward_tree_mahakam_border_story_pt1;Mahakam is a land of contradictions. Red-hot forges hidden beneath ice and snow. The Continent's most advanced technology developed by its most conservative society...
reward_tree_mahakam_border_story_pt2;Although wars on the Continent are almost a yearly occurrence, Mahakam maintains its constant neutrality at the crossroads of the borders – a position no kingdom dare challenge, for none wish to provoke the dwarves' ire. Besides, they must purchase their weapons from someone...
reward_tree_mahakam_border_story_pt3;Merchants who travel to Mahakam typically witness but a mere fraction of the dwarven realm's enormity. Much like an iceberg, only a small part of Mahakam is visible above the surface. The real treasures and wonders are found underground, in caverns inaccessible to humans.
reward_tree_mahakam_border_story_pt4;In Mahakam, the dwarves are safe... But not free. Every aspect of their lives is regulated by the Foredwarves' Codex, and every decision must be ratified by the council of clan elders. Unable to endure a life under strict control, many flee to live among humans and work as craftsmen. Others join the Scoia'tael...

reward_tree_meve_chest_1;At first, Meve rarely demonstrated the affections expected of a loving wife. Thus, Reginald sought advice from the noble ladies of his court, who were all in agreement: to win Meve's heart, a gift must be bestowed that would show the depths of the king's love. Alas... Meve proved rather selective. Without a word of explanation, she discarded the finest Ofiri tapestries, flung the sapphire-studded necklaces out the window, and splintered a Koviri lute against her chamber floor. Yet when Reginald presented her a suit of exquisite, gilded plate armor, well... That cold metal melted Meve's heart.
reward_tree_meve_chest_2;Meve possessed many fine qualities: keen insight, breathtaking beauty, and unrivaled bravery. Yet like everyone, she was not without fault. Greatest among them was perhaps her failure to grasp the nature of human weakness. She measured others by the impossible standards she set for herself, and hence quickly bonded with those of equally strong character. Those of a more "sensitive" constitution she held in disfavor – sometimes even contempt. As a result, her relationships with her sons was strained from the very start. This was especially true of her eldest – Villem.
reward_tree_meve_chest_3;Tucked away within the queen's castle in Rivia was a superbly stocked armory, where every manner of exquisite steelwork could be found: elven blades, specially cast Hawker flails... Yet of all the finely tuned instruments of death at her disposal, Meve most highly prized the Mahakam-forged sihil uniquely dubbed the "Sharp Bastard." When asked how the blade acquired such a moniker she merely replied with a heavy sigh. Evidently, the question brought old memories to the fore, both deeply intimate and somber.
reward_tree_meve_story_pt1;Princess Meve was the bane of every royal governess. Rather than knit, she preferred climbing trees. Instead of practicing scales on the harp, she sparred with her brothers using wooden swords. And in lieu of romance novels, she pored over the memoirs of decorated generals.
reward_tree_meve_story_pt2;It was decided that Meve should be married off as soon as possible. Alas, few men of noble birth were willing to ask for the hand of a scrappy sixteen-year-old with scratched knees and bruises every color of the rainbow…
reward_tree_meve_story_pt3;In the end, it was the King of Rivia, Reginald the Courageous, who claimed her hand. Despite not displaying a particularly keen intellect, he proved far wiser than Meve's governesses. Rather than attempt to tame the unruly princess, he simply fell in love with her for who she was.
reward_tree_meve_story_pt4;Sadly, their idyllic union did not last long. Reginald died but a few years later. Neighboring sovereigns presumed the newly widowed Queen would collapse under the weight of the crown; thus, even before the bells of mourning had ceased their tolling, they crossed the border into Rivia. Yet, what awaited the invaders proved a surprise most unpleasant...

reward_tree_monsters_chest_1;Though difficult to envision now, the Continent was once entirely devoid of monsters. However, that changed over one thousand years ago following the Conjunction of the Spheres – the result of a particularly unfortunate alignment of the planets. Worlds once separate began to merge, plunging the Continent into centuries of chaos, soaking the earth in blood.
reward_tree_monsters_chest_2;In time, humans learned to cope with their monstrous new neighbors. They discovered that many beasts are repelled by salt, hence they scattered it in protective barriers. Through trial and error, they learned that a red ribbon worn on the wrist frightens off nekkers, likewise silver with werewolves and vampires. Last but not least, using both magic and alchemy, they created witchers – itinerant monster-slayers for hire.
reward_tree_monsters_chest_3;"Which monster is most dangerous?" A common topic for debate among the Continent's inhabitants. Is it a fiend, whose wither measures 10 feet? A griffin that can shred an armored knight and his mount in one fell swoop? Or perhaps an arachas, whose venom is so poisonous that just one drop can incapacitate an adult man? The truth is that none of these have killed as many people as the common rat, which exposed all of the Northern Kingdoms to the Catriona Plague...
reward_tree_monsters_story_pt1;Humans enjoy marking arbitrary lines on maps, imagining themselves the supreme rulers of the land. Yet, within these borders they draw are forests, swamps, and uninhabited expanses where they dare not venture, for these are still the domains of monsters.
reward_tree_monsters_story_pt2;The Continent is, indeed, home to an astonishing number and variety of monstrosities. Necrophages, relicts, hybrids, draconids... To this day, new species are still being discovered by explorers who, to no great surprise, rarely live long enough to claim a second discovery.
reward_tree_monsters_story_pt3;There is rich diversity among monster species. From mindless, bloodcrazed beasts, such as ghouls, to the frighteningly intelligent, such as higher vampires. From gargantuan fiends to nekker swarms. Yet, they do share a common thread. Humans. Or rather... their appetite for human flesh.
reward_tree_monsters_story_pt4;Yet, it is precisely because of this diversity that humans have been able to maintain some semblance of control over the Continent.

reward_tree_nilfgaard_chest_1;Nilfgaardians interpret loyalty quite differently than the rest of the Continent. For their emperor, they would jump head first into a pool of acid. Yet the moment their leader shows the slightest hint of weakness, it's as if his power turns to smoke and vanishes in the wind. The seat of the Empire cannot allow a mere ounce of incompetence, for due to its vastness and influence, even a minor mistake can lead to far-reaching and unforeseen consequences.
reward_tree_nilfgaard_chest_2;Many believe that Nilfgaard owes its dominance to its superbly equipped legions of heavy infantry. The truth is slightly more complex, however, for Nilfgaard acquires most of its territories without ever declaring war. It often suffices to deploy an assassin to remove the inconvenient leader, then send diplomats to deftly orchestrate the ensuing conflict between his heirs.
reward_tree_nilfgaard_chest_3;In contrast to their squabbling Nordling neighbors, Nilfgaardians have tremendous respect for the law. A court sentence, however unjust, is immediately executed to the letter. Imperial edicts may as well be the word of the gods. As a result, Nilfgaard is incomparably more organized than the kingdoms of the North... And its soldiers execute even the cruelest orders without question.
reward_tree_nilfgaard_story_pt1;Nilfgaard is a nation of extremes. It is the largest, richest, most populated, most powerful and, without a doubt, the most ruthless.
reward_tree_nilfgaard_story_pt2;Nilfgaardians will stop at nothing to defeat their foes. The slaughter of civilians? An unavoidable pity. Poisoning wells? A pragmatic stratagem. Forcing slaves into a suicidal assault? Well... piled corpses work wonders for scaling walls.
reward_tree_nilfgaard_story_pt3;The word "peace" does not exist in the Nilfgaardian language. Ever since chroniclers began keeping records, Nilfgaard has unceasingly conquered, annexed, and vassalized their neighbors. And they won't rest until the Golden Sun shines upon the entire Continent.
reward_tree_nilfgaard_story_pt4;But why this need to conquer? Centuries of armed conflict have made the Nilfgaardian economy entirely dependent on the spoils of war and slave labor.

reward_tree_northern_chest_1;The Northern Realms are bordered by three mountain ranges to the north, east, and south – the Dragon, Blue, and Amell Mountains – and the Great Sea to the west. Yet, what lies beyond these? Nordlings themselves are not quite certain, and to be honest, it's not their most pressing concern. Preoccupied by local disputes, quarrels, and wars, they haven't the time to take interest in foreign lands. Alas, the Nilfgaardian invasion serves as proof that the rest of the world is not of the same mind.
reward_tree_northern_chest_2;What links a town like Vizima, proud capital of Temeria, or Oxenfurt, a center of learning for all the North, with Aedd Gynvael, a provincial settlement at the end of the known world? Nothing, it would seem... After all, each of these places looks, sounds and even smells different. Their origins, however, are identical – all were founded atop ancient elven cities. The ruins sprawling beneath their streets bear witness to this fact. What caused elven civilization to collapse? Plague? Cataclysm? No... Their destruction was wrought by humans.
reward_tree_northern_chest_3;Nordlings often feel conflicted about magic and those who practice it. On the one hand, mages served an undeniably crucial role in the North's defense against Nilfgaard. Yet on the other, their unabashed egotism and tendency to meddle in politics became an irritation to communities and sovereigns alike. The epitome of such arrogance was Philippa Eilhart who, rather than sit content as king's counsel, resolved to take on a leading role herself. This dream would not last, however... And in the end, the flames of pyres raged across the North.
reward_tree_northern_story_pt1;Temeria, Redania, Kaedwen, Aedirn, Kovir, Poviss... There are few who can keep track of the North's many kingdoms and duchies. No sooner had humans seized the land from dwarves and elves than shattered it into dozens of tiny pieces and continued the fight for control amongst each other.
reward_tree_northern_story_pt2;Time and time again, come the thaw of spring, the leaders of the North resumed their petty wars. Temeria attempted to strip Sodden from Cintra. Aedirn and Kaedwen vied for control of the Pontar Valley. Yet, when the black-clad Nilfgaardian legions appeared from the south, they reckoned that, in the end, they stood more united than divided.
reward_tree_northern_story_pt3;When the Nilfgaardian invasion began, most presumed the North would be obliterated in a matter of weeks. Yet, to their great surprise, the outnumbered and underequipped Nordlings managed to repel the Empire's legions.
reward_tree_northern_story_pt4;Had the involvement of mages proved the deciding factor in the North's victory? Or was it the tactical genius of well-trained generals?

reward_tree_oak_story_chest_1;According to legends, the oldest oak in the world is the Great Bleobheris. It sprouted from the Acorn thrown by the waves, long before any humanoid races settled on the Continent. The Bleobheris clearing is a place of frequent rallies, stops for travelers, and meetings of hikers. Druids who look after the ancient tree are happy to host everyone here -- regardless of their status, religion, or race. It was under Bleobheris that the famous bard Dandelion used to sing his ballads.\nUnfortunately, due to the Great Oak's easy access -- and despite the respect it generally commands -- some pranksters have, over the years, carved profanities into the living bark.
reward_tree_oak_story_chest_2;One of the old⁠—but less famous⁠—oaks is the Tree of Tidings of Good and Evil, which grows at the crossroads behind the village of Koprzywnica. The population of the entire area, even those from the distant Spalla, use its huge, rather low branches to hang slats and boards with various announcements on them, including sketches of missing persons, love letters, philosophical arguments, and offers of erotic massage and related services.
reward_tree_oak_story_pt_1;Oaks are exceptional trees. Not only druids but also common folk worship them widely, and the old oak groves are considered sacred throughout the Continent. Whoever starts a fire in one of them will feel the wrath of humans, nonhumans, and gods alike.
reward_tree_oak_story_pt_2;On Ard Skellig, the sacred grove of Gedyneith is not only a place of worship. All major ceremonies are held here, including weddings, funerals, and coronations of rulers. And also -- executions of the worst criminals and traitors.
reward_tree_oak_story_pt_3;In Toussaint, in the heart of the Myrkvid Forest, there is an oak grove. It is an inviolable sanctuary, according to the compacts concluded with the druids by Duchess Anna Henrietta.

reward_tree_ofir_chest_1;The first expedition from Ofir was led by Dulla kh'Amanni, or rather the first one that was well documented by historians. There is evidence, however, in the form of Ofiri weapons and decoctions, that suggests a much earlier expedition took place from the land beyond the sea to the Continent. Besides, Dulla's journey would not be as well-known if it weren't for one detail - knowledge and trade were only a cover for the Ofiri's real goal. He was sent by the powerful king Nibras to find the monarch's son who disappeared during his travels to the Northern Kingdoms. Unfortunately, Dulla was not successful. The king was informed of his son's death and Dulla was stuck at the Upper Mill, awaiting further orders. Tired of the rural surroundings, he longed to return to his country.
reward_tree_ofir_chest_2;According to legend, the Crow Mother is the oldest and most powerful of the living flaminicas. She leads a mysterious druid clan in the Gedyneith grove. No one knows, including the druids she leads, whether she is merely a human that can speak crow or the spirit of a crow enchanted into a human body. Or maybe she was a powerful crow deity once, ousted by Freya and eventually forgotten? The theories differ. But there's no doubt that the Crow Mother's followers are not afraid to peer into the darkness or reach for the most potent Ofiri decoctions, as opposed to the more restrained and, according to them, more cowardly druids from other circles.
reward_tree_ofir_chest_3;The Van Moorlehem family is known for their atypical need for slave labor. Apparently, without it, they would not be able to maintain their prestige or their extravagant lifestyle. It's said in the North that a Nilfgaardian aristocrat will not move a finger until a slave does it for him. On the surface, the Van Moorlehems fit in perfectly. Only on the surface, though, because it's hard to find a servant at their palace. It could be said that after the showy parties, regularly and gladly organized by Ophelie Van Moorlehem - Vincent's wife, the ruler of his heart and co-owner of their fortune - their residence stands practically empty. If, however, a slave happens to somehow wander around the palace grounds, the heir to the dynasty, Philippe Van Moorlehem, takes them for a trip to the woods from where they never come back. Hence the family's high demand for "fresh blood"... They'd also like to try the slaves from Ofir, as long as they bleed as readily as the others.
reward_tree_ofir_story_pt1;The only things a typical Nordling knows about Ofir is what he hears in rumors, so a lot of nonsense and not a whole lot of truth. But most rumor-mongers agree on several points…
reward_tree_ofir_story_pt2;First of all, Ofir's located somewhere at the end of the world, far beyond the seas. Second of all, there are no normal animals there. The horses are either white with black stripes or mean and hunchbacked, while cattle have tails growing out of their faces instead of their rears.
reward_tree_ofir_story_pt3;It's surprising, then, that the Ofiri merchants look like normal human beings - they have one head each, as many limbs as they should and behinds in the right places. Still, they haggle like fiends and create wonders like no Nordling can.
reward_tree_ofir_story_pt4;In the eyes of the Ofiri, the inhabitants of the Northern Kingdoms are simple barbarians. Even the famously progressive Nilfgaardians seem like a largely backward nation to them. Unfortunately, ambushes by the Scoia'tael and the numerous hardships encountered by merchants on their journeys across the Continent only reinforce that viewpoint.

reward_tree_scoiatael_chest_1;The Scoia'tael's identifying symbol is a squirrel tail pinned to the belt or cap. Perhaps it has something to do their nimbleness and agility in the forest. If not, then their decision to use this particular rodent is indeed puzzling. Not least because in the regions with the greatest Scoia'tael presence, squirrels are on the brink of extinction. Oh, the irony...
reward_tree_scoiatael_chest_2;The Scoia'tael do not employ the rigid hierarchy of traditional armies. The partisans are divided into groups called commandos, each usually about a dozen strong. The unit's commander is typically a warrior who has displayed exceptional bravery... As well as extreme cruelty toward humans.
reward_tree_scoiatael_chest_3;It is worth emphasizing that not every non-human supports the Scoia'tael. Many perceive the partisans as shortsighted, naive rebels who likely do more harm than good. The sharpest criticisms of the Squirrels, interestingly enough, came from none other than Brouver Hoog... Characteristically ignorant to the nuances of non-human affairs, most humans nevertheless lump them all into the same group.
reward_tree_scoiatael_story_pt1;Not many on the Continent understand Elder Speech – the language of the elves and dwarves. That said, all are familiar with the word "Scoia'tael," or Squirrels – warriors who fight for the rights of non-humans... And don't shy away from cruelty...
reward_tree_scoiatael_story_pt2;Thrown into crowded ghettos, harrassed at every street corner, elves and dwarves awaited the perfect moment to strike back at the callous kingdoms of the North.

Yet when it turned out the Empire had overestimated their own might and were forced to seek peace with the Northern Kingdoms, the newborn alliance quickly began to unravel...
reward_tree_scoiatael_story_pt4;Betrayed by Nilfgaard, despised by the Northern Realms, the Scoia'tael were in no position to achieve victory. Yet, by no measure did this mean they would surrender. Overcome with hatred, they continue to fight – not for victory, but vengeance.

Seeing the great potential in Novigrad's criminal underworld, he entrenched himself under the alias Sigi Reuven and quickly garnered tremendous influence.

reward_tree_skellige_chest_1;In the Skellige Isles' rich pantheon of gods, the most prominent place belongs to Freya –  goddess of love, fertility, hearth, and harvest. Many consider her the same deity as the beloved Melitele, who is worshipped on the mainland. Though this is best left unsaid on the islands, for Skelligers would consider such a comparison as sacrilege. Freya is also the patron goddess of soothsayers, seers, and telepaths, a fact demonstrated by her associated symbols: a cat who sees and hears what is hidden; a falcon that observes from high above, and Brisingamen – the prophetic necklace of legend.
reward_tree_skellige_chest_2;The Skellige Isles are home to seven clans: Brokvar, Dimun, an Craite, Drummond, Tordarroch, Heymaey and Tuirseach. Members from each considers themselves to be the strongest and the bravest – and any would eagerly duel those who dare question their might. That said, Skelligers recognize authority over the Isles in one king, chosen by popular vote. And who is eligible to have their name considered? Any and all – regardless of sex, age, or lineage.
reward_tree_skellige_chest_3;Skelligers are more closely bound to nature than most on the Continent. Nowhere else do druids command so much respect as in Skellige. Nowhere else do hunters treat animals with such regard. In no other army's ranks do bears roar with such ferocity.

reward_tree_svalblod_chest_1;The heart of the Svalblod cult was rooted at Fornhala, a settlement situated atop the nigh impassable mountains of Ard Skellig. After worship of the cruel idol became forbidden on the isles, the village's homes were deserted, its temples had fallen into disrepair. Yet those who have since stepped foot on the grounds of Fornhala – be they shepherds herding stray sheep or adventurers seeking shelter from a blizzard – have sworn by the gods upon their return of what they witnessed... Fresh blood glistening on altars to Svalblod and the roar of bears still echoing from caverns below...
reward_tree_svalblod_chest_2;Alas, the truth of the cult's survival struck the islanders in the harshest of ways. A feast at Kaer Trolde organized by Jarl Crach an Craite was violently interrupted by bloodsoaked massacre. Normally, for a feast to end in a brawl would come as no great surprise, perhaps even the preferred way to cap the night. Yet, in this case, several of the guests transformed into ferocious bears, eviscerating innocents. Fortunately, fate spared some lucky lives by delivering a seasoned witcher to the castle that very day...
reward_tree_svalblod_chest_3;The advent of the Crimson Curse emboldened Svalblod's fanatics. They emerged from hiding, worshipping their cruel god with newfound zeal. Many young warriors with dreams of glory and unstoppable strength succumb to the whispers of the cult's depraved druids and take part in their forbidden rituals. Jarls have convened to discuss whether to lead another raid into the mountains of Ard Skellig... Or to forget conflicts of the past and use the bear god's followers to defend Skellige against its foes.
reward_tree_svalblod_story_pt1;Skelligers hold a special reputation on the Continent for their cruelty. In truth, the folk of the isles do indeed revel in battle, in blood honorably spilt. Though as with all things, some live at an extreme, worshipping an idol who personifies the frenzy and remorseless cruelty of battle. He is called Svalblod.
reward_tree_svalblod_story_pt2;Svalblod is an incarnation of both man and bear in such a way that can give even the grizzliest Skelligers nightmares. His deformed body is not unlike a battlefield in itself where contradictory elements perpetually clash – a true embodiment of the grotesque.
reward_tree_svalblod_story_pt3;His acolytes would take a hallucinogenic decoction before heading deep within a cave at the heart of Ard Skellig. Once there, the cavern's bears would feast upon them alive. Then, like parasites, the cultists would seize control of the beasts' bodies.

They seized Svalblod's followers, bound them to longships, and cast them out to the high sea without a sail to guide them. This was to be the final blow to eradicate the cult once and for all.

After all, what were these backwater lands in the greater scheme of Emhyr var Emreis' far-reaching ambitions?
reward_tree_tb_story_pt3;Queen Meve refused to lay down her arms, though few believed she stood a chance to reclaim her homeland. Though as history tells us, the people of the Continent would soon be surprised... None more so than the Nilfgaardians.

reward_tree_unseen_elder_chest_1;Despite centuries of seclusion in his lair, the Unseen Elder knows Common Speech. Yet the few daring souls who have met him and survived warn of his dangerous impatience with conversation. Just one half-baked question, one lie... And his fangs are at your throat. All are powerless in such a circumstance – even those with the superhuman reflexes of a witcher.
reward_tree_unseen_elder_chest_2;On their honor, the residents of Toussaint swear that sometimes on calm, still nights, the waters of Lac Célavy carry strange, foreign whispers that make skin crawl and hair stand on end. It is the Unseen Elder, speaking to his brothers and sisters, counseling patience. For one day, the gates between the worlds will open again, and they shall at last return from whence then came.
reward_tree_unseen_elder_chest_3;Vampires regard the Unseen Elder with a fawning respect. Upon entering his presence, they bow deeply and bestow offerings. When the Unseen Elder makes demands of them, they subserviently carry out his wishes without a moment's hesitation. Is it not frightening to think what might happen should the Unseen Elder one day emerge from his lair into our world, unite an army of vampiric minions, and declare war on the human race? Well, certainly. Yet such an event is likely to never occur... Right?
reward_tree_unseen_elder_story_pt1;In the caverns beneath Toussaint, an aeons-old vampire patiently awaits the next Conjunction of the Spheres. His brethren call him the Unseen Elder, and mortals – well... One cannot name what one does not know to exist.
reward_tree_unseen_elder_story_pt2;The Unseen Elder craves not power, wealth nor even blood. His sole desire is to return to the world from which he has long been exile. For centuries he has watched the gate between worlds that now stands closed to him.
reward_tree_unseen_elder_story_pt3;Hanging silently from the cavern's ceiling, the Unseen Elder appears perfectly still as if plunged into a deep slumber, not unlike a bat in winter. Yet swift and terrifying danger awaits any who dare disturb his rest or threaten the gate between worlds.
reward_tree_unseen_elder_story_pt4;One word – enough for the Unseen Elder to demand obedience from any vampire. One movement – enough to slice a foe in two. As a general rule, it's best to give the caves beneath Toussaint a wide, wide berth.

reward_tree_usurper_chest_1;The Usurper did all he could to grant a semblance of legitimacy to his rule and strengthen his authority. In every major city he erected statues in his honor. He paid poets thousands of florens to craft works in praise of his magnificence, and instructed historians to unearth documentation proving that he was the illegitimate son of the Emperor Torres. Any who were foolish enough to make mention of his peasant origins would have their tongue removed by the Usurper's own hands.
reward_tree_usurper_chest_2;The Usurper's cruelty was legendary. He instituted strict military rule across the empire. Even the slightest offense was punishable by lashing, and more serious crimes either by mutiliation – or excruciating death. The Usurper had hoped these methods would bring order to an empire embroiled in chaos. Alas, the result was rather the opposite.
reward_tree_usurper_chest_3;Having secured his own power through murder, the Usurper placed a high value on spies and assassins. As a result, during his rule the Empire's intelligence apparatus rose to new heights, and alchemists concocted new, alarmingly effective poisons. Emhyr var Emreis criticized his predecessor's methods, calling them cruel and unbecoming of a ruler... Though, of course, he later made frequent use of them himself.
reward_tree_usurper_story_pt1;Not a lot is known about the Usurper – not even his name. His killer and successor, Emhyr var Emreis, made sure of that.
reward_tree_usurper_story_pt2;The Usurper was the lead conspirator in the plot to assassinate Fergus var Emreis... And to viciously torture the emperor's son and heir, Emhyr.
reward_tree_usurper_story_pt3;Yet, beyond that, how much is truly known? Allegedly, he was a man of the fields, a simple peasant by birth who rose to the rank of general through cunning and courage in battle. But, as the saying goes, the more you hold, the more you desire...
reward_tree_usurper_story_pt4;Merchants and nobles disappointed with Fergus' rule observed the celebrated general with keen interest. They fell over each other in their attempts at flattery and guarantees of support... And yet eventually, once deprived of his crown, he found himself utterly alone.

reward_tree_viper_2_chest;When master Ivar Evil-Eye instructed Kolgrim to look for the lost weapon diagrams that once belonged to their order, bad luck struck again. Although the witcher managed to find the legendary diagrams, he never returned to their keep.\nIn the small village of White Orchard, Kolgrim was accused of kidnapping the beekeeper’s son. The local baronet, wishing to appease the enraged people, called for a qualified torturer. Justice would be served, no matter what. Their justice, of course, so in response Kolgrim invoked Temerian common law, demanding a trial by ordeal. Surprisingly, the baronet agreed and ordered the witcher to cleanse his family crypt of wraiths.\nAccording to official sources, Kolgrim perished in the attempt. Yet rumors claimed otherwise. Some locals, enraged by the lordling’s decision, supposedly attacked the witcher before he even entered the crypt. The beekeeper had taken his rightful revenge, cutting the mutant’s head off with his own hands… Well, ‘twas just a rumor. But one thing became clear over time.\nIt was drowners that killed the missing boy. Not Kolgrim.
reward_tree_viper_2_story_pt1;Fate seemed to take pleasure in torturing Kolgrim. Fortune only smiled upon him if it was accompanied by a stroke of very bad luck. It was always thus, even before Kolgrim became a witcher. When he was still a young harmless brat…
reward_tree_viper_2_story_pt2;On the eve of Saovine small Kolgrim was kidnapped by a weeper, which replaced him with its own cursed offspring. Fortunately, the monster was slaughtered by a witcher that very same night. The boy’s savior, having taken pity on him, decided to escort him back home. Kolgrim was relieved to be returning to the warmth and safety of his mother, unaware of his impending misfortune.
reward_tree_viper_2_story_pt3;The woman greeted the witcher with hatred in her eyes, not believing a single word that came out of his mouth. Blinded by her contempt, she refused to even look twice at her own crying son, utterly convinced that the weeper’s baby was her real child. With the door slammed shut in their face, the witcher had no other choice than to take Kolgrim with him – straight to the Viper School.
reward_tree_viper_2_story_pt4;Over many future years, fate mocked Kolgrim many times – both during his murderous training and the later travels around the Continent. His life ended most ironically. For he, who was once stolen and then rejected from his mother, was accused of kidnapping a child.

reward_tree_viper_avatar_chest_1;Witchers have many weapons in their arsenal: swords both silver and steel, chains, daggers, and throwing knives. Two-handed weapons are uncommon for one simple reason – weight. But for Letho of Gulet, that was never an issue. He swung a two-handed blade with the same ease and speed that others enjoy when wielding a dagger or rapier.
reward_tree_viper_avatar_chest_2;The relationship between Letho and another legendary witcher, Geralt of Rivia, was rather... Complicated. At different points in time, each of them had both saved and threatened the other's life. But how did their odd story finally end? It depends on whom you ask. Some believe that Geralt killed Letho at the ruins of Loc Muinne, while others claim that the two had agreed to part ways in peace. Alas, the truth yet remains a mystery...
reward_tree_viper_avatar_chest_3;Letho was always aware of the impression he had upon others. He never raised his voice nor made threats, for there was no need. He knew his very appearance was enough to make the even the fiercest bandits shake in their boots. Letho also knew that he appeared to others as a dull-witted thug. Yet, despite possessing a superior intelligence, he made no attempt to challenge this impression. He knew people could be careless with their words if they thought they were speaking to a dumb sack of potatoes.
reward_tree_viper_avatar_story_pt1;Witcher training places great importance on endurance and agility rather than strength alone. After all, what good can a hulking mountain of muscle do against the lightning-fast strikes of a bruxa or striga... Right?
reward_tree_viper_avatar_story_pt2;Letho of Gulet was a witcher of the School of the Viper – an misleading association given his imposing stature. Though as large as a fiend and strong as a bull, his reflexes and agility rivaled those of other witchers... Making him an extremely formidable opponent.
reward_tree_viper_avatar_story_pt3;His prowess in combat would, indeed, have a major impact on the people of the Continent, for he struck down not one, but two leaders in the North... Yet, what could have led Letho from his path as a monster slayer to that of an assassin of kings?
reward_tree_viper_avatar_story_pt4;Letho was determined to reopen the fallen School of the Viper. To achieve his goal, he was prepared to enter any necessary alliance – the Empire included. Yet in the end, nothing came of his arrangement with Emhyr var Emreis, and fate showed once again that witchers should steer clear of politics...
reward_tree_viper_avatar_title;Letho of Gulet
reward_tree_viper_border_chest_1;The School of the Viper no longer exists, yet what exactly led to its demise is not precisely known. Most likely, it was closed by Emhyr var Emreis when he no longer found value in it. Knowing the emperor and his favored methods, one could reasonably suspect that the school's closure spelled a death sentence for every one of its members.
reward_tree_viper_border_chest_2;Today, weapons and armor from the Viper School are collectors' items for Vedyminaica enthusiasts – those who occupy themselves with the literature and history of the witcher profession. The owner of the largest collection of such relics was the Countess Mignole of Oxenfurt. Yet what compelled a highborn lady to take such a keen interest in monster hunters? She alone holds the answer.
reward_tree_viper_border_chest_3;Although witchers are hired to protect people from monsters, they are often repaid with distrust – even outright hostility. Kolgrim, a witcher from the Viper School, experienced such suspicion firsthand. While working on a contract in White Orchard, a local boy went missing. The villagers unanimously accused the witcher of abducting the child, and – ignoring his pleas of innocence – brought the witcher's life to a gruesome end. The townsfolk learned later that the boy had been killed by a drowner. Alas, it was too late for their judgment to be undone...
reward_tree_viper_border_story_pt1;It is oft said that witchers took on the characteristics of their schools' namesake creatures. Without a doubt, this was true of the Viper School. They were agile, quick, and frequently made use of deadly poisons.
reward_tree_viper_border_story_pt2;As with the other witcher schools – the Wolves' Kaer Morhen as sole exception – none were aware of the Viper School's location. Only one detail ever became widely known... That it stood somewhere south of the Yaruga. In Nilfgaard.
reward_tree_viper_border_story_pt3;Perhaps it's no wonder then that Vipers were less inclined to neutrality than other witchers. The Empire would never recognize such a stance. There is only obedient servant... Or mortal enemy.
reward_tree_viper_border_story_pt4;For this reason, few in the North were surprised to learn that the assassin of King Demavend III of Aedirn and King Foltest of Temeria wore a viper-shaped medallion – and that soon thereafter Nilfgaard readied itself for war.

reward_tree_voorhis_chest_1;Morvran Voorhis' greatest passion was horses. He could tell a Koviri pony from a Zerrikanian bay from just the clop of their hooves. It's said he could tame and ride a wild horse captured that very morning. To what did Voorhis owe his fascination with the beasts? He used to say that he preferred their company, for he found them to be far more honest than men...
reward_tree_voorhis_chest_2;Raised in the imperial court, Morvran Voorhis quickly developed the refinement of a courtier. He never missed a chance to compliment a lady of the court, knew the steps to every dance, and had sophisticated tastes for both wine and literature. Yet behind this facade, something unsettling lurked. His glazed, watery eyes were reminiscent of a zeugl's as it waits beneath the filth, poised to strike...
reward_tree_voorhis_chest_3;Voorhis ascended to the throne by way of conspiratorial plot. Thus, he understood the threat of hidden schemes, and once in power, he thought himself surrounded by conspirators and plotters. Pathologically paranoid, he never trusted his advisors, and punished even the smallest offenses with torture and death. As is often the case, his paranoia became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Rather than await their turn in the gallows, what remained of the aristocracy simply removed him from the throne...
reward_tree_voorhis_story_pt1;Morvran Voorhis often said he didn't need a sword to win a war. There was much truth in those words.
reward_tree_voorhis_story_pt2;At its core, Voorhis's strategy relied on spies, saboteurs, and provocateurs. There was little honor in it, perhaps, but none could deny its effectiveness.
reward_tree_voorhis_story_pt3;In preparation for war, Voorhis sent his enemies dozens of letters, the contents of which were full of clichéd ultimatums and hollow threats. What mattered most, however, was that his emissaries have a thorough look around and report back their findings...
reward_tree_voorhis_story_pt4;When war eventually broke out, Voorhis already knew precisely where to find enemy camps and supply lines, where prisoners were being held, and which enemy officers to intimidate, which to bribe... And of course, which of them were best dealt with by an assassin's blade

reward_tree_warrior_avatar_chest_1;While other officers of the Wild Hunt occupied their free time with pastimes of refined taste – such as Ge'els, who at every available opportunity put paint to canvas – Imlerith preferred the simple pleasures. Whenever the Red Riders halted their spectral raids, he set off for Bald Mountain to enjoy the company of the succubi who called it home...
reward_tree_warrior_avatar_chest_2;Imlerith was on intimate terms with the Crones from Crookback Bog. Through their magic he acquired tremendous strength. Each time he visited the Ladies of the Wood, they offered him acorns from the mountain's ancient oak, cooked for three days and nights in children's blood. It was this macabre nut that granted him great power... And twisted his mind.
reward_tree_warrior_avatar_chest_3;Imlerith had many lives on his conscience... If "conscience" is even the proper term. Among them was a certain witcher from the School of the Wolf, whose name I struggle to put to paper... The mere thought of his death at the hands of that Aen Elle barbarian boils my blood. The inquisitive reader can no doubt learn his identity from other sources...
reward_tree_warrior_avatar_story_pt1;The term "elven warrior" brings to mind a lithe, acrobatic swordsmaster in light armor, slicing surgically at arteries with the very tip of an elegant blade. Imlerith was a different sort of elven warrior...
reward_tree_warrior_avatar_story_pt2;Clad head to toe in hulking plate armor, this elf charged fearlessly into battle, pulverizing his foes into a bloody pulp with an immense two-handed mace. As bones cracked and blood splattered, a grotesque, twisted laugther could be heard from behind his helm.
reward_tree_warrior_avatar_story_pt3;Imlerith's fighting technique was far from subtle, but proved undeniably effective. The ferocious elf wreaked havoc on the battlefield, rarely encountering any who could stand as his equal.
reward_tree_warrior_avatar_story_pt4;Though in time, he would eventually meet his match in Geralt of Rivia, the White Wolf. Their duel was long and arduous, but in the end it was Imlerith who fell – his face scorched by the witcher's Igni Sign.

reward_tree_warrior_border_chest_1;The Continent has endured countless conflicts, yet by far its most devastating war was between the fractured kingdoms of the North and united front of the Nilfgaardian Empire from the South. Although the North and South had already waged three wars against each other, laying waste to vast swathes of the Continent, their feud was far from settled. Once one side eventually succumbs to the other, the Pontar and the Yaruga will run red with blood.
reward_tree_warrior_border_chest_2;Still to this day, the Battle of Brenna during the Second Northern War was the largest battle in the Continent's history. More than forty thousand soldiers fought for both the Northern and Southern sides: light and heavy infantry, mercenaries, elven cavalry, dwarven shieldbearers... Yet it was one man who ultimately determined the battle's outcome – Lamarr Flaut, a Nilfgaardian officer who, during his reconnaissance, failed to notice thousands of infantrymen in the North's reserve. An oversight that proved Nilfgaard's demise.
reward_tree_warrior_border_chest_3;One of the Continent's most highly regarded war historians was a certain Jarre of Ellander. His descriptions of battles left no want for detail, yet spared superfluous embellishments and patriotic rhetoric. In his retellings, he does not describe war as a simple series of honorable skirmishes, but a savage and chaotic slaughter. Jarre's unique perspective might have something to do with his own military service, where he not only bore witness to the atrocities firsthand, but was personally marred by them – forever losing an arm.
reward_tree_warrior_border_story_pt1;The arrival of spring is greeted with mixed feelings by inhabitants of the Continent. On the one hand, the melting snow spells an end to hunger, but on the other – it heralds the coming of yet more war.
reward_tree_warrior_border_story_pt2;War is an inherent factor of life on the Continent. Year after year, rulers attempt to extend their borders, raid lands unfamiliar. Yet with every battle, the number of their subjects dwindles more and more...
reward_tree_warrior_border_story_pt3;For generations, scholars, mages, and priests have called on leaders to lay down their arms and put an end to this cycle of slaughter. If they do not cease, these experts warn, the Continent will plunge into an era far darker and more terrible than the times following the Conjunction of the Spheres.
reward_tree_warrior_border_story_pt4;Alas, kings and queens refuse to take heed.

reward_tree_wild_boar_chest_1;The combative, warrior-like nature of boars makes them them a popular choice in heraldry. They appear most infamously on the von Everec coat of arms from which Olgierd, the leader of the Redanian Free Company, is descended. And contrary to what some landlocked folk on the Continent would have you believe, the Wild Boar of the Sea is the moniker given to Skelligan jarl Crach an Craite and his longship. There are no known varieties of boar indigenous to the waters of the Great Sea.
reward_tree_wild_boar_story_pt1;The boar is a woodland creature, and an ornery, aggressive one at that. On the outskirts of Kaedwen, a rumor circulates that the beasts have a taste for virgin blood... Of course, the truth is much simpler: boars are perfectly content with vegetables – even just a few earthy carrots.
reward_tree_wild_boar_story_pt2;Mother nature endowed the boar with two pairs of sharp, protruding tusks – the upper and lower canines. Truly, a formidable beast. Woe betide any who encounters a wild boar in the forest and has difficulty climbing trees...
reward_tree_wild_boar_story_pt3;Boars have a firm, elongated snout that somewhat resembles a flute, though of course, sadly, cannot be used as such. Folk often claim it's as if boars hold a grudge against nature's cruel irony – that's what drives them to overturn fences and ransack their potato patches.
reward_tree_wild_boar_story_pt4;The boar differs from the pig not only in the thickness of its bristles, but also in its disposition. Pigs are timid, easily spooked, whereas boars readily stand their ground. Even their grunts sound more hostile, as if to say, "Find your own potatoes, arsehole."

reward_tree_wild_hunt_2_story_chest;When the elf sage lost the battle with the White Frost, she escaped to the new world of the Aen Elle, opening the gates on her own—because it was not only her appearance and behaviour that had changed. A power awoke within her, thanks to which she was able to bend time and space to her will. Later on, this power made her the first Navigator, as well as the leader of the Wild Hunt, and gave rise to the legend of the Queen of Winter.\nAccording to the story, the Queen was supposed to traverse the sky during a blizzard, scattering hard, sharp pieces of ice all around. And woe to he who caught a shard in the eye or the heart. For such a person was forever lost, abandoning everything to relentlessly pursue his beloved Queen, and unable to ever reach her, perished of longing.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_2_story_pt1;Even the early generals of the Wild Hunt had no idea how many centuries their Queen had already lived. But elves joked that she was as old as the world—the very one which the Aen Elle had abandoned when the White Frost came.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_2_story_pt2;Only a few remembered that she once bore only an elven name. Before becoming the Queen of Winter, she was a widely respected sage. Brave, ambitious, and stubborn. She did not even bow to the imminent destruction of the world. Instead of escaping with her people through Ard Gaeth, she decided to face the White Frost by herself.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_2_story_pt3;Considering the fate of the Alder Folk, it's not difficult to guess the outcome of this clash. Neither the Aen Saevherne's magic nor her knowledge stopped the inevitable. The gene of the Elder Blood, however, was strong enough to moderate the effects of the White Frost and save the elf's life.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_2_story_pt4;The sage finally returned to the Aen Elle, but she was… changed. There was a perceptible aura of iciness around her, and she was cold to the touch. It took just one look of her to freeze a man to the bone. And everything that was not white snow seemed to be ugly, disgusting, and dull to her.\nAmong elves, some argued that the White Frost had not so much changed her as became a part of her.

reward_tree_wild_hunt_avatar_chest_1;Unlike other officers of the Wild Hunt, Caranthir never removed his helm. Some believe it was to create an aura of mystery, to emphasize his unique and important status. Others – that the genetic experiments from which he was bred left him with visible side effects – severe disfigurements he wished to conceal from all...
reward_tree_wild_hunt_avatar_chest_2;Caranthir was a daunting opponent. Capable of bending time and space, he could disappear in a blink – only to suddenly reappear behind his opponent to deliver a swift, killing blow. Few have faced him and survived... And all of them wore witcher medallions round their necks.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_avatar_chest_3;This elite navigator of the Wild Hunt rarely breaks his silence, yet when he does, he limits himself to a scant few words. But why? Perhaps because he views the world differently than other mortals. Countless times Caranthir has witnessed dimensions collide. He has heard the sound of time rushing by and the crunch of bending space. Our languages are likely incapable of describing such otherworldly experiences, and perhaps that is why he forsook them.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_avatar_story_pt1;Interdimensional travel is no simple feat: biting cold, twisting timelines, the folding and tangling fabrics of space. For these reasons, the Wild Hunt was in need of an exceptional navigator – one such as Caranthir Ar-Feiniel.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_avatar_story_pt2;A small quantity of the Elder Blood flows through Caranthir's veins. Though not enough to open gates between worlds, he is able pry futher open what is already there...
reward_tree_wild_hunt_avatar_story_pt3;Caranthir's birth was the result of intensive work spanning years. The creator of the Wild Hunt, Avallac'h, traced back through his family's lineage – parents, grandparents, great-grandparents... All for the sole purpose of locating long-dormant genes.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_avatar_story_pt4;One could argue that Caranthir is the grand culmination of an extraordinary and ambitious project... Or, that he is a monstrosity and abomination – that his very existence is an affront to nature and the gods alike.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_avatar_title;Caranthir Ar-Feiniel
reward_tree_wild_hunt_border_chest_1;Like ice shards following in a comet's wake, the hounds of the Wild Hunt hurtle behind the Aen Elle riders. Reportedly, they sometimes lose their way and descend from the night sky, sowing death and destruction on the surface. No one truly knows just what the beasts are. Could they be as golems – insentient automatons composed of lifeless matter, blindly obedient to their creators? Or perhaps they existed even before the rise of the Wild Hunt, beings born of magic and eternal frost, trapped between dimensions?
reward_tree_wild_hunt_border_chest_2;In rare instances, an unfortunate soul abducted by the Wild Hunt has found their way home. Yet the survivor comes to realize that centuries have passed since their disappearance – the graves of loved ones are weathered and covered in moss, their dwellings are derelict or long since destroyed. Driven mad from despair, physically and mentally broken from their murderous toil, they wander the Continent, reciting their tale of captivity to any who listens. Yet by what means did they escape? A secret passage between the worlds? Or, perhaps more likely, the Aen Elle allowed them to leave, to spread fear among the people of the Continent...
reward_tree_wild_hunt_border_chest_3;Though the decision to create the Wild Hunt was ultimately made by the king of the Aen Elle, Auberon Muircetach, the architect behind the idea was an elven sage known as Avallac'h. It was he who began the genetic experiments that led to the birth of navigators – elves capable of creating safe passage between open dimensional gates – and he who developed the necessary spells. Then, when his work was finished and the Hunt took to the skies, Avallac'h realized he had created a monster.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_border_story_pt1;The Aen Elle are elves who are convinced of their own racial superiority. They believed that the hard, filthy labor required on their vast estates was suited only for other, inferior races. For their wish to become reality, the Wild Hunt was born.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_border_story_pt2;Riders of the Wild Hunt abducted individuals from all races: humans, dwarves, and even their cousins – the Aen Seidhe elves. Apparently, when work needs doing, one cannot afford to be picky...
reward_tree_wild_hunt_border_story_pt3;Yet why all this newfound drive and effort to tend to their lands? Quite simply, the world of the Aen Elle was dying – growing ever colder and ever darker. For their increasingly frozen, barren land to bear fruit, it required the fertilization of sweat and blood.
reward_tree_wild_hunt_border_story_pt4;And so the raids of the Wild Hunt raged on, the spectral cavalcade leaving deserted villages in its wake. The riders could never rest, for should their duty end, so too would their world.

reward_tree_wolf_2_story_chest;For many, the phrase "with age comes wisdom" often doesn't apply, but for Vesemir, it is surely the case. However, it was not the numerous punishments imposed on him by Barmin that ended his disobedience, but the harsh reality of consequences⁠—specifically, when others had to pay the price for his sins. When his nighttime indulgences ended up costing the life of someone he promised to defend... Well, that was enough to change the witcher's ways. And with each preventable death he witnessed, he became more and more serious, year after year, until he took on the role of fencing master at Kaer Morhen. Famous for his extensive knowledge and rigorous approach to training, he ensured his young witcher adepts were thoroughly disciplined⁠—for their own good, and the well-being of those they would later have to protect.
reward_tree_wolf_2_story_pt1;Though it is hard to believe now, Vesemir was once young. After his Trial of Grasses, he was still trying to grow his first beard. Fortunately, he was completely unscathed by the murderous training he underwent⁠—collecting no scars nor deformations. Apart from the colour of his eyes, nothing about his appearance betrayed the witcher mutations.
reward_tree_wolf_2_story_pt2;Thus, when the young Vesemir⁠—together with master Barmin⁠—set out on the trail for the first time, he found a simple way to hide his provenance. He wore a wide-brimmed hat. The one and only that became Papa Vesemir's famous hat, which no other witcher was allowed to wear, especially Lambert.
reward_tree_wolf_2_story_pt3;Donning his voluminous cloak and favourite hat, young Vesemir sneaked out under Barmin's nose to devote himself to activities frowned upon by his mentor. In short, he wandered around the local pubs, took part in every possible party and wedding, or climbed the balconies of various mansions to reach one of the court ladies' bedrooms. As for the houses of ill repute... Suffice to say that Vesemir visited more of them in his long life than Eskel, Lambert and Geralt combined.
reward_tree_wolf_2_story_pt4;And master Barmin, well… Sometimes he turned a blind eye to the actions of his unruly student, but more often he scolded young Vesemir and gave him some extremely boring, time-consuming task as punishment. Like polishing swords, for example.

Initially, the witcher had planned to dub himself Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde, but his mentor, Vesemir, in a few short yet sharp words, convinced him it might not be the best idea. And rightfully so!
reward_tree_wolf_avatar_chest_2;Geralt had the custom of giving all his horses the very same name – Roach – no matter whether stallion or mare. And every steed which bore the name was exceptionally well-mannered. One whistle and the horse would appear right at his side. That is, given that there weren't any obstacles in the way...
reward_tree_wolf_avatar_chest_3;At every opportunity – even if the situation hadn't called for it – Geralt expressed his hatred for portals. A perfectly reasonable attitude given that portals are not the safest means of transport, despite what mages would have you believe. It's not uncommon for a traveler to experience nausea and headaches after emerging from a portal – even to emerge in an entirely unexpected location. Or, indeed, fail to emerge at all.
reward_tree_wolf_avatar_story_pt1;Does such a man truly need introduction? Well, for those living under a rock, I present to you Geralt of Rivia – witcher from the School of the Wolf, known to elves and dryads as Gwynbleidd, the greatest swordsman of the North. Behold the White Wolf – a true legend for the ages.
reward_tree_wolf_avatar_story_pt2;Geralt's list of feats seems to go on without end. It was he who lifted the curse that plagued Princess Adda of Temeria, expelled the djinn from the city of Rinde, and slew the King of the Wild Hunt. Yet was there anything from his life of which he was most proud?
reward_tree_wolf_avatar_story_pt3;Indeed, there was – being a good father to Ciri. He taught her everything he knew, surrounded her with love, and gave her support in their most difficult times. When Ciri's circumstances were most dire and she sought him out for help, Geralt never let her down.
reward_tree_wolf_avatar_story_pt4;For you see, though Geralt of Rivia had survived the Trial of the Grasses, possessed superhuman reflexes and catlike eyes, and was on first-name terms with kings, his desire in life was quite simple. He wished to be with people he loved – and to have all others leave him be.

reward_tree_wolf_border_chest_1;Following a massacre from decades past, Kaer Morhen was besieged yet again – this time by Salamandra, a secretive and powerful criminal organization, which at these times shook the underworld of Temeria and Redania to its core. Although the witchers managed to defend their home, they failed to prevent the theft of their witcher mutagens. The consequences of their failure were evident before long...
reward_tree_wolf_border_chest_2;The Wolf School's obstacle course on which witchers-in-training honed their balance and endurance was commonly called "The Gauntlet." As you might surmise from its name, the exercises on this trail proved an extreme challenge. Ambitious, young witcher lads were made to perform pirouettes on a narrow beams, dodge massive, spiked logs, and duel with mobile sparring dummies... Oh, and while blindfolded.
reward_tree_wolf_border_chest_3;Every witcher from the School of the Wolf wears a silver medallion in that predator's image. Not only do they serve as an identifying marker of the school, but also as a protective amulet. The magic-imbued pendant vibrates and hums when its owner draws close to a Place of Power... Or a dangerous monster.
reward_tree_wolf_border_story_pt1;Of all the witcher schools, the School of the Wolf is most widely recognized. Its notoriety is due largely to its most famous member, one Geralt of Rivia... Yet, is also due in part to Kaer Morhen's tragic past.
reward_tree_wolf_border_story_pt2;This fortress, situated at the edge of the world, tucked away in the mountains of Kaedwen, had served throughout the ages as the home for witchers of the Wolf School. At one time, dozens had lived there... Today, you could count its living members on the fingers of one hand.
reward_tree_wolf_border_story_pt3;For years upon years, witchers have been ostracized and vilified by humans. And yet, rather than quash false rumors and gossip, they bided their time, convinced their actions would speak louder than words. When, one fateful day, a frenzied mob assembled before their gate, they had realized their error. By then, however, it was already too late.
reward_tree_wolf_border_story_pt4;Today, the fortress of Kaer Morhen lies in ruin. Its towers are slowly crumbling, its walls are collapsing, the roofs have given way to rot. The Wolf School's last remaining witchers still try to keep their home intact – yet without any real conviction. They know their time has all but passed.

scoia_fluff_description;The Continent was once ruled by elves, dwarves, and gnomes – known to most as the Elder Races. Yet humans have since driven them to desolate mountain ranges and dense woodlands. Their last remaining scraps of land are wrested from them as they are left to perish of hunger and disease. Some elves and dwarves, however, seek a different death – their hands not empty, but wet in human blood. With squirrel tails pinned to their caps and belts, they prowl the roadsides, eager to kill any dh'oine who crosses their path. The Scoia'tael shall never claim lasting victory over their oppressors, a fact they well know. Yet rather than dampen their spirits, their resolve to resist has never proved stronger. After all, they've nothing left to lose.

ske_fluff_description;Several hundred miles off the Continent's western coast lie the Skellige Isles. Compared to the Northern Realms and the Nilfgaardian Empire, they appear as mere inkblots on the map. How could it be that they remain unconquered? Well, the truth is... Many have tried. Shipwrecks of enemy fleets litter the coasts, and Skelligan warriors drink mead from their foes' rusted helms. Yet, for decades now, no outside force has sailed against the isles, a reality which has the islanders worried. After all, without the crucible of battle, how can they find glory and secure their place at the table of their ancestors? They've no choice but to board their longships, regale in song, and set sail for fertile lands across stormy seas, in search of plunder and blood...
